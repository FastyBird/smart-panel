### Property Details

#### `temperature`

Defines the heating threshold in Celsius:

- Specifies the maximum temperature before the heating mechanism activates.

> [!Example]:
If the current temperature goes below the minimum temperature, then the heating mechanism should turn on to increase
the current temperature until the minimum temperature is reached.

#### `status`

Indicates the current state of the heater:

- `true`: The heater is heating.
- `false`: The heater is inactive.

#### `position`

Represents the current openness of the valve as a percentage:

- `0%`: Fully closed
- `100%`: Fully open
- Intermediate values indicate partial opening

Used to monitor or set the effective opening level for thermostatic radiator valves.
