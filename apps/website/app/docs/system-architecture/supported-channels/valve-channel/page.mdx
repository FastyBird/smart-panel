| **Property** | **Data Type** | **Range**                                     | **Unit** | **Permissions** |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------|
| `on`         | `Bool`        | `true/false`                                  | -        | RW (Read/Write) |
| `type`       | `Enum`        | `generic/irrigation/shower_head/water_faucet` | -        | RW (Read/Write) |

### Property Details

#### `on`

Indicates whether the valve is open or closed:

- `true`: The valve is open, allowing water to flow.
- `false`: The valve is closed, stopping the flow of water.

#### `type`

Specifies the type of valve being controlled:

- Possible values:
    - `generic`: A general-purpose valve.
    - `irrigation`: A valve used in irrigation systems.
    - `shower_head`: A valve integrated into a shower head.
    - `water_faucet`: A valve associated with a water faucet.

|--------------|---------------|--------------------|----------|-----------------|
| `duration`   | `Ushort`      | `0–3600`           | s        | RW (Read/Write) |
| `remaining`  | `Ushort`      | `0–3600`           | s        | RO (Read-Only)  |
| `mode`       | `Enum`        | `manual/scheduled` | -        | RO (Read-Only)  |
| `position`   | `Uchar` or `Enum` | `0–100` or `closed/quarter/half/three_quarter/open` | %        | RW (Read/Write) |
| `fault`      | `Uchar`       | `0–255`            | -        | RO (Read-Only)  |

---

### Property Details

#### `duration`

Specifies the duration for which the valve should remain open:

- Measured in seconds (`s`).
- Example: `duration = 300` keeps the valve open for 5 minutes.

#### `remaining`

Indicates the time remaining before the valve automatically closes:

- Measured in seconds (`s`).
- Example: If `remaining = 120`, the valve will close in 2 minutes.

#### `mode`

Specifies how the valve is being operated:

- Possible values:
    - `manual`: The valve is controlled directly by the user.
    - `scheduled`: The valve is controlled according to a predefined schedule.

#### `position`

Represents the current openness of the valve. This property supports multiple data types:

**Option 1 - Percentage:**
- **Data Type**: `Uchar`
- **Range**: `0–100%`
- `0%`: Fully closed.
- `100%`: Fully open.
- Intermediate values indicate partial opening.

**Option 2 - Discrete States:**
- **Data Type**: `Enum`
- **Values**: `closed`, `quarter`, `half`, `three_quarter`, `open`
- Predefined position states.

This property is the primary way to read or set the target position.

#### `fault`

Represents the fault state of the actor:

- `0`: No fault detected.
- Non-zero: A fault has been detected, potentially affecting functionality.
