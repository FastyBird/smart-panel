## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Environmental Monitoring**:
    - Track temperature, humidity, pressure, and air quality for comprehensive environmental awareness.

2. **Safety Detection**:
    - Detect smoke, gas leaks, carbon monoxide, and other safety hazards. Receive alerts for immediate action.

3. **Security Monitoring**:
    - Detect motion, occupancy, and contact states for security automation.
