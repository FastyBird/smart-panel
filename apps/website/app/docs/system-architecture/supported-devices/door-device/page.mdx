## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Door Control**:
    - Open and close doors remotely using the door channel. Track current position for garage doors.

2. **Security Monitoring**:
    - Monitor door state with contact sensor. Detect motion near the door for security alerts.

3. **Access Management**:
    - Integrate with lock channel for secure access control.

## Developer Notes

1. The door channel is required for open/close control.
2. Contact channel provides state feedback independent of door control.
3. Motion detection enhances security near entry points.
