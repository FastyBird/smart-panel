## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the valve:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `valve` | Controls fluid or gas valves, managing open/close states or flow rates. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/valve-channel) |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, including manufacturer details, model information, and operational statuses. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

---

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `battery` | Reports the status of a device's battery, including level, charging state, and operational health. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/battery-channel) |
| `electrical_energy` | Measures the total energy consumption over time, typically reported in kilowatt-hours (kWh). | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-energy-channel) |
| `electrical_power` | Reports real-time power metrics such as voltage, current, and wattage for monitoring and diagnostics. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-power-channel) |
| `flow` | Monitors the rate of fluid or air flow, typically measured in cubic meters per hour (m3/h). | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/flow-channel) |
| `leak` | Identifies the presence of water or other liquids to detect leaks and prevent damage. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/leak-channel) |
| `pressure` | Reports atmospheric or liquid pressure values, typically measured in pascals (kPa). | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/pressure-channel) |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Flow Control**:
    - Open and close valves to control water or gas flow. Support for partial opening where applicable.

2. **Safety Monitoring**:
    - Detect leaks and monitor pressure for system safety.

3. **Utility Management**:
    - Track flow rates for water or gas usage monitoring.

## Developer Notes

1. The valve channel is required for open/close control.
2. Battery channel is important for wireless valve controllers.
3. Leak and pressure monitoring enhance safety.
