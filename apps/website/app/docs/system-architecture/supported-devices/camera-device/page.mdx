## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the camera:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `camera` | Provides video and image data streams from surveillance or monitoring cameras. This channel supports configuration and control of camera devices, such as surveillance cameras or babysitting monitors. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/camera-channel) |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, including manufacturer details, model information, and operational statuses. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `battery` | Reports the status of a device's battery, including level, charging state, and operational health. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/battery-channel) |
| `contact` | Tracks the open or closed state of a contact point, such as a door, window, or cabinet. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/contact-channel) |
| `humidity` | Measures the relative humidity in the environment, reported as a percentage. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/humidity-channel) |
| `light` | Controls lighting devices, supporting brightness, color temperature, and color adjustments. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/light-channel) |
| `microphone` | Represents audio input devices, reporting activity or capturing sound. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/microphone-channel) |
| `motion` | Detects motion in an area to trigger alerts or automate responses. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/motion-channel) |
| `speaker` | Controls speaker devices, including volume, mute state, and audio output modes. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/speaker-channel) |
| `temperature` | Measures the current temperature in an environment, reported in degrees Celsius. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/temperature-channel) |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Video Surveillance**:
    - Access live video streams and capture images using the camera channel. Use for security monitoring or baby monitoring applications.

2. **Motion Detection**:
    - Detect movement in the camera's field of view to trigger alerts or start recording.

3. **Two-Way Communication**:
    - Use microphone and speaker channels for audio communication through the camera.

## Developer Notes

1. The camera channel is required for video/image functionality.
2. Motion detection helps reduce bandwidth and storage usage.
3. Light channel can control built-in IR or status LEDs.
