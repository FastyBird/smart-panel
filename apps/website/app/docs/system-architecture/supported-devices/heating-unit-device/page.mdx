## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the heating unit:

| **Channel**          | **Description**                                                                | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `heater`             | Controls the heating functionality, including activation and settings.         | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/heater-channel)             |
| `temperature`        | Measures the current temperature in an environment, reported in degrees Celsius. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/temperature-channel)        |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, such as manufacturer, model, and firmware. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel**         | **Description**                                                             | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                           |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `electrical_energy` | Measures the total energy consumption over time, typically reported in kWh. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-energy-channel) |
| `electrical_power`  | Reports real-time power metrics such as voltage, current, and wattage.      | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-power-channel)  |
| `humidity`          | Measures the relative humidity in the environment, reported as a percentage. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/humidity-channel)          |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Space Heating Control**:
    - Set a target temperature and activate heating through the `heater` and `temperature` channels.
    - Monitor room temperature in real-time using the `temperature` channel.

2. **Environmental Monitoring**:
    - Use the `humidity` channel for enhanced climate control and comfort optimization.
    - Track ambient conditions alongside temperature for comprehensive room monitoring.

3. **Energy Management**:
    - Track power usage in real-time with the `electrical_power` channel.
    - Use the `electrical_energy` channel for long-term energy consumption insights and cost optimization.

## Developer Notes

1. **Channel Implementation**:
    - Implement all required channels for core heating functionality.
    - Add optional channels for energy and humidity monitoring based on device capabilities.

2. **Integration**:
    - Ensure the `heater` channel is mapped to the heating control mechanisms.
    - Include the `device_information` channel for proper device identification.

3. **Energy Tracking**:
    - Use `electrical_energy` and `electrical_power` channels to provide energy efficiency metrics.

4. **Extensibility**:
    - Add the `humidity` channel to support combined heating and humidity regulation.
    - Use the `temperature` channel for precise thermal management.
