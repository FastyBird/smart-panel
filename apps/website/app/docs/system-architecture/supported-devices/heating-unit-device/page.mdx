## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the heating unit:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `heater` | Manages heating devices, allowing control of temperature settings and modes. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/heater-channel) |
| `temperature` | Measures the current temperature in an environment, reported in degrees Celsius. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/temperature-channel) |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, including manufacturer details, model information, and operational statuses. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

---

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `electrical_energy` | Measures the total energy consumption over time, typically reported in kilowatt-hours (kWh). | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-energy-channel) |
| `electrical_power` | Reports real-time power metrics such as voltage, current, and wattage for monitoring and diagnostics. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-power-channel) |
| `humidity` | Measures the relative humidity in the environment, reported as a percentage. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/humidity-channel) |
| `contact` | Tracks the open or closed state of a contact point, such as a door, window, or cabinet. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/contact-channel) |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Temperature Control**:
    - Set target temperatures and heating modes using the heater channel. Monitor current temperature with the temperature channel.

2. **Energy Management**:
    - Track heating energy consumption for cost analysis and efficiency optimization.

3. **Window Detection**:
    - Use contact sensors to detect open windows and automatically adjust heating.

## Developer Notes

1. Heater and temperature channels are required for core functionality.
2. Contact channel enables energy-saving automation when windows are open.
3. Humidity monitoring helps maintain comfortable indoor conditions.
