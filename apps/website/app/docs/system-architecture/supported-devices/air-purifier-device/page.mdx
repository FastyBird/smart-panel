## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the air purifier:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `fan` | Controls fan devices, including speed, oscillation, and modes for air circulation. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/fan-channel) |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, including manufacturer details, model information, and operational statuses. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

---

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `air_quality` | Reports overall air quality index (AQI) and quality level. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/air-quality-channel) |
| `filter` | Monitors the filter status and remaining life, with option to reset after replacement. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/filter-channel) |
| `air_particulate` | Monitors the concentration of particulate matter (e.g., PM2.5 and PM10) in the air, providing insights into air quality and pollution levels. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/air-particulate-channel) |
| `carbon_dioxide` | Monitors CO2 levels in the environment to track air quality and ventilation efficiency. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/carbon-dioxide-channel) |
| `carbon_monoxide` | Detects the presence of carbon monoxide (CO) to ensure safety in enclosed spaces. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/carbon-monoxide-channel) |
| `humidity` | Measures the relative humidity in the environment, reported as a percentage. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/humidity-channel) |
| `leak` | Identifies the presence of water or other liquids to detect leaks and prevent damage. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/leak-channel) |
| `nitrogen_dioxide` | Monitors the concentration of NO2 in the air, often used in environmental and industrial monitoring. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/nitrogen-dioxide-channel) |
| `ozone` | Measures ozone (O3) levels in the air, often used in environmental quality assessments. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/ozone-channel) |
| `pressure` | Reports atmospheric or liquid pressure values, typically measured in pascals (kPa). | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/pressure-channel) |
| `sulphur_dioxide` | Measures sulphur dioxide (SO2) levels in the air for environmental monitoring. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/sulphur-dioxide-channel) |
| `temperature` | Measures the current temperature in an environment, reported in degrees Celsius. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/temperature-channel) |
| `volatile_organic_compounds` | Monitors the concentration of VOCs in the air to track pollution or air quality. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/volatile-organic-compounds-channel) |
| `electrical_energy` | Measures the total energy consumption over time, typically reported in kilowatt-hours (kWh). | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-energy-channel) |
| `electrical_power` | Reports real-time power metrics such as voltage, current, and wattage for monitoring and diagnostics. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-power-channel) |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Air Quality Improvement**:
    - Use the fan channel to control purification speed. Monitor air quality with air_quality and air_particulate channels.

2. **Environmental Monitoring**:
    - Track multiple air quality metrics including CO2, VOCs, and particulate matter for comprehensive air quality assessment.

3. **Filter Management**:
    - Monitor filter status and remaining life to ensure optimal performance.

## Developer Notes

1. The fan channel is required as the primary control mechanism.
2. Multiple air quality sensors can be added based on device capabilities.
3. Filter channel is important for maintenance scheduling.
