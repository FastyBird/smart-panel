## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the sprinkler:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `valve` | Controls fluid or gas valves, managing open/close states or flow rates. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/valve-channel) |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, including manufacturer details, model information, and operational statuses. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

---

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `electrical_energy` | Measures the total energy consumption over time, typically reported in kilowatt-hours (kWh). | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-energy-channel) |
| `electrical_power` | Reports real-time power metrics such as voltage, current, and wattage for monitoring and diagnostics. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-power-channel) |
| `flow` | Monitors the rate of fluid or air flow, typically measured in cubic meters per hour (m3/h). | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/flow-channel) |
| `humidity` | Measures the relative humidity in the environment, reported as a percentage. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/humidity-channel) |
| `leak` | Identifies the presence of water or other liquids to detect leaks and prevent damage. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/leak-channel) |
| `pressure` | Reports atmospheric or liquid pressure values, typically measured in pascals (kPa). | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/pressure-channel) |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Irrigation Control**:
    - Open and close water valves to control watering zones. Schedule watering times based on needs.

2. **Environmental Monitoring**:
    - Monitor soil humidity and adjust watering based on conditions.

3. **Water Management**:
    - Track water flow and pressure for efficient water usage.

## Developer Notes

1. The valve channel is required for water flow control.
2. Humidity sensors can measure soil moisture for smart irrigation.
3. Flow monitoring helps detect leaks or blockages.
