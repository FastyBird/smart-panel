## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the switcher:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, including manufacturer details, model information, and operational statuses. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

---

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `outlet` | Controls and monitors electrical outlets. | Yes | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/outlet-channel) |
| `switcher` | Controls and monitors electrical switches. | Yes | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/switcher-channel) |
| `electrical_energy` | Measures the total energy consumption over time, typically reported in kilowatt-hours (kWh). | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-energy-channel) |
| `electrical_power` | Reports real-time power metrics such as voltage, current, and wattage for monitoring and diagnostics. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-power-channel) |

## Channel Constraints

### One or More Required

At least one channel from each of the following groups must be present:

- `outlet` or `switcher`

### Mutually Exclusive

The following channel groups cannot be used together:

- `outlet` **OR** `switcher`

---

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Power Switching**:
    - Toggle power to connected devices using outlet or switcher channels. Support for multiple independent switches.

2. **Energy Monitoring**:
    - Track power consumption across all connected devices.

## Developer Notes

1. Device must have either outlet OR switcher channels (mutually exclusive).
2. Multiple channels of the same type are supported.
3. Energy monitoring is optional but recommended.
