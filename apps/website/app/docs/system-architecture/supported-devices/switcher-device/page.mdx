# Switcher Device

<Callout type="info">
	**Device Category**: `switcher`
</Callout>

The **Switcher** device represents a controllable outlet or switch that can toggle the power supply to connected devices and monitor energy usage. It supports either multiple outlets or multiple switches for power control.

## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the switcher device:

| **Channel**          | **Description**                                                                | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, such as manufacturer, model, and firmware. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

---

## Conditional Channels

<Callout type="warning">
	**At least one** of the following channels must be present. The `outlet` and `switcher` channels are **mutually exclusive** — a device can have either outlets or switchers, but not both.
</Callout>

| **Channel** | **Description**                                  | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `outlet`    | Controls and monitors electrical outlets.        | Yes          | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/outlet-channel) |
| `switcher`  | Controls and monitors electrical switches.       | Yes          | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/switcher-channel) |

---

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel**         | **Description**                             | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                           |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `electrical_energy` | Tracks total energy consumption over time.  | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-energy-channel) |
| `electrical_power`  | Provides real-time power usage information. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-power-channel)  |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Power Control with Outlets**:
   - Use the `outlet` channel to toggle the power supply on or off for connected devices.
   - For multi-outlet devices, control each outlet independently.

2. **Power Control with Switches**:
   - Use the `switcher` channel for simple on/off toggle control.
   - Ideal for wall switches or basic relay controls.

3. **Energy Monitoring**:
   - Track energy consumption with the `electrical_energy` channel for billing or usage optimization.
   - Monitor real-time power usage with the `electrical_power` channel to identify energy-hungry devices.

## Developer Notes

1. **Channel Implementation**:
   - The `device_information` channel is required for identifying the device and providing basic metadata.
   - Choose either `outlet` or `switcher` channels based on the device type — they cannot be mixed.
   - Implement multiple channels of the chosen type for devices with multiple controllable switches or sockets.

2. **Integration**:
   - Add the `electrical_energy` and `electrical_power` channels to enable energy monitoring features.

3. **Extensibility**:
   - This device can be further enhanced by adding custom features for specific hardware, like timers or schedules for each outlet or switch.

4. **Handling Multiple Channels**:
   - Ensure that each `outlet` or `switcher` channel is uniquely identified and managed within the device for seamless user control.
