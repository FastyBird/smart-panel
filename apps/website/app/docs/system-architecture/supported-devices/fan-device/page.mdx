## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the fan:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `fan` | Controls fan devices, including speed, oscillation, direction, and modes for air circulation. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/fan-channel) |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, including manufacturer details, model information, and operational statuses. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

---

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `electrical_energy` | Measures the total energy consumption over time, typically reported in kilowatt-hours (kWh). | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-energy-channel) |
| `electrical_power` | Reports real-time power metrics such as voltage, current, and wattage for monitoring and diagnostics. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-power-channel) |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Air Circulation**:
    - Control fan speed and direction for optimal air circulation. Enable oscillation for wider coverage.

2. **Energy Monitoring**:
    - Track power consumption for energy efficiency analysis.

## Developer Notes

1. The fan channel is required for all fan control operations.
2. Energy monitoring channels are optional but useful for smart home analytics.
