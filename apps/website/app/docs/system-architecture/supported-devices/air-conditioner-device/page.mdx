## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the air conditioner:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `cooler` | Controls devices that lower air or liquid temperatures, such as air conditioners or refrigeration systems. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/cooler-channel) |
| `fan` | Controls fan devices, including speed, oscillation, and modes for air circulation. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/fan-channel) |
| `temperature` | Measures the current temperature in an environment, reported in degrees Celsius. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/temperature-channel) |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, including manufacturer details, model information, and operational statuses. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `electrical_energy` | Measures the total energy consumption over time, typically reported in kilowatt-hours (kWh). | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-energy-channel) |
| `electrical_power` | Reports real-time power metrics such as voltage, current, and wattage for monitoring and diagnostics. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-power-channel) |
| `heater` | Manages heating devices, allowing control of temperature settings and modes. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/heater-channel) |
| `humidity` | Measures the relative humidity in the environment, reported as a percentage. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/humidity-channel) |
| `contact` | Tracks the open or closed state of a contact point, such as a door, window, or cabinet. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/contact-channel) |
| `leak` | Identifies the presence of water or other liquids to detect leaks and prevent damage. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/leak-channel) |
| `filter` | Monitors the filter status and remaining life, with option to reset after replacement. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/filter-channel) |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Cooling and Fan Control**:
    - Set a target temperature using the cooler and temperature channels. Adjust fan speed and direction via the fan channel.

2. **Environmental Monitoring**:
    - Monitor room temperature and humidity for better climate control. Detect leaks using the leak channel to ensure safety.

3. **Energy Management**:
    - Track power usage and energy consumption using the electrical_power and electrical_energy channels.

## Developer Notes

1. Implement all required channels for core air conditioning functionality.
2. Add optional channels based on the specific features of the device.
3. The device_information channel is mandatory for device identification.
4. Include electrical_energy and electrical_power for energy efficiency tracking.
5. Use the leak channel for enhanced safety in environments prone to water-related issues.
