# Pump Device

<Callout type="info">
	**Device Category**: `pump`
</Callout>

The Pump device represents a water or fluid pump with functionality for flow control, monitoring, and energy tracking.

## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the pump:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `switcher` | Represents binary switches to control devices like lights, fans, or appliances. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/switcher-channel) |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, including manufacturer details, model information, and operational statuses. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

---

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `flow` | Monitors the rate of fluid or air flow, typically measured in cubic meters per hour (m3/h). | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/flow-channel) |
| `electrical_energy` | Measures the total energy consumption over time, typically reported in kilowatt-hours (kWh). | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-energy-channel) |
| `electrical_power` | Reports real-time power metrics such as voltage, current, and wattage for monitoring and diagnostics. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-power-channel) |
| `leak` | Identifies the presence of water or other liquids to detect leaks and prevent damage. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/leak-channel) |
| `pressure` | Reports atmospheric or liquid pressure values, typically measured in pascals (kPa). | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/pressure-channel) |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Pump Control**:
    - Turn the pump on or off using the switcher channel. Monitor flow rate when available.

2. **Flow Monitoring**:
    - Track fluid flow rate and pressure for system health monitoring.

3. **Leak Detection**:
    - Detect leaks in the pumping system to prevent water damage.

## Developer Notes

1. The switcher channel is required for on/off control.
2. Flow and pressure channels provide operational insights.
3. Leak detection is recommended for safety.
