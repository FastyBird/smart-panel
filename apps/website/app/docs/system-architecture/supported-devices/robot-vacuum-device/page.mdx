## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the robot vacuum:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `battery` | Reports the status of a device's battery, including level, charging state, and operational health. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/battery-channel) |
| `robot_vacuum` | Controls robotic vacuum cleaners, providing commands for start, stop, docking, and monitoring states. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/robot-vacuum-channel) |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, including manufacturer details, model information, and operational statuses. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

---

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `electrical_energy` | Measures the total energy consumption over time, typically reported in kilowatt-hours (kWh). | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-energy-channel) |
| `electrical_power` | Reports real-time power metrics such as voltage, current, and wattage for monitoring and diagnostics. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-power-channel) |
| `leak` | Identifies the presence of water or other liquids to detect leaks and prevent damage. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/leak-channel) |
| `filter` | Monitors the filter status and remaining life, with option to reset after replacement. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/filter-channel) |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Cleaning Control**:
    - Start, stop, and dock the robot vacuum. Select cleaning modes and manage cleaning schedules.

2. **Status Monitoring**:
    - Monitor battery level, cleaning state, and current location. View cleaning history and coverage.

3. **Maintenance Alerts**:
    - Track filter status and receive maintenance notifications.

## Developer Notes

1. Battery and robot_vacuum channels are required for core functionality.
2. Filter channel helps track maintenance needs.
3. Leak detection can alert to spills in cleaning area.
