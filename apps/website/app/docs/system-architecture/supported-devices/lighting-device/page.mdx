## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the lighting:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `light` | Controls lighting devices, supporting brightness, color temperature, and color adjustments. | Yes | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/light-channel) |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, including manufacturer details, model information, and operational statuses. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

---

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `electrical_energy` | Measures the total energy consumption over time, typically reported in kilowatt-hours (kWh). | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-energy-channel) |
| `electrical_power` | Reports real-time power metrics such as voltage, current, and wattage for monitoring and diagnostics. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-power-channel) |
| `illuminance` | Detects ambient light levels, typically measured in lux, to monitor brightness in a space. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/illuminance-channel) |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Illumination Control**:
    - Control brightness, color temperature, and color using the light channel. Support for multiple light elements in a single fixture.

2. **Adaptive Lighting**:
    - Use the illuminance channel to automatically adjust lighting based on ambient light levels.

3. **Energy Monitoring**:
    - Track lighting energy consumption for efficiency analysis.

## Developer Notes

1. The light channel is required and supports multiple instances for multi-element fixtures.
2. Illuminance sensor enables automatic brightness adjustment.
3. Not all lights support color or color temperature - check device capabilities.
