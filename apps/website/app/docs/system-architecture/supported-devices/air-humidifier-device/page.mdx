## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the air humidifier:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `humidifier` | Controls the humidifier, including on/off state, target humidity, mist settings, and operating modes. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/humidifier-channel) |
| `humidity` | Measures the relative humidity in the environment, reported as a percentage. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/humidity-channel) |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, including manufacturer details, model information, and operational statuses. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

---

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `fan` | Controls fan devices, including speed, oscillation, and modes for air circulation. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/fan-channel) |
| `electrical_energy` | Measures the total energy consumption over time, typically reported in kilowatt-hours (kWh). | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-energy-channel) |
| `electrical_power` | Reports real-time power metrics such as voltage, current, and wattage for monitoring and diagnostics. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-power-channel) |
| `leak` | Identifies the presence of water or other liquids to detect leaks and prevent damage. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/leak-channel) |
| `temperature` | Measures the current temperature in an environment, reported in degrees Celsius. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/temperature-channel) |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Humidity Control**:
    - Set target humidity levels and mist intensity using the humidifier channel. Monitor current humidity with the humidity channel.

2. **Environmental Monitoring**:
    - Track room temperature and humidity for optimal comfort and health.

3. **Safety Features**:
    - Detect water leaks to prevent overflow and water damage.

## Developer Notes

1. The humidifier and humidity channels are required for core functionality.
2. Optional fan channel allows independent mist/fan speed control.
3. Leak detection is recommended to prevent water overflow incidents.
