## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the water heater:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `heater` | Manages heating devices, allowing control of temperature settings and modes. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/heater-channel) |
| `temperature` | Measures the current water temperature, reported in degrees Celsius. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/temperature-channel) |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, including manufacturer details, model information, and operational statuses. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

---

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `electrical_energy` | Measures the total energy consumption over time, typically reported in kilowatt-hours (kWh). | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-energy-channel) |
| `electrical_power` | Reports real-time power metrics such as voltage, current, and wattage for monitoring and diagnostics. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-power-channel) |
| `leak` | Identifies the presence of water leaks to prevent damage. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/leak-channel) |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Water Temperature Control**:
    - Set target water temperature using the heater channel. Monitor current water temperature with the temperature channel.

2. **Energy Efficiency**:
    - Track energy consumption to optimize heating schedules and reduce costs.

3. **Leak Prevention**:
    - Detect water leaks early to prevent damage and water waste.

## Developer Notes

1. Heater and temperature channels are required for core functionality.
2. Leak detection is highly recommended for safety.
3. Energy monitoring helps optimize heating schedules.
