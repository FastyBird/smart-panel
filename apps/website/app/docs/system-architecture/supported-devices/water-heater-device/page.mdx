## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the water heater:

| **Channel**          | **Description**                                                                | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `heater`             | Controls the heating functionality, including activation and settings.         | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/heater-channel)             |
| `temperature`        | Measures the current water temperature, reported in degrees Celsius.           | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/temperature-channel)        |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, such as manufacturer, model, and firmware. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel**         | **Description**                                                             | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                           |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `electrical_energy` | Measures the total energy consumption over time, typically reported in kWh. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-energy-channel) |
| `electrical_power`  | Reports real-time power metrics such as voltage, current, and wattage.      | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-power-channel)  |
| `leak`              | Identifies the presence of water leaks to prevent damage.                   | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/leak-channel)              |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Water Temperature Control**:
    - Set a target water temperature and activate heating through the `heater` and `temperature` channels.
    - Monitor water temperature in real-time using the `temperature` channel.

2. **Safety Monitoring**:
    - Use the `leak` channel to detect water leaks early and prevent property damage.
    - Receive alerts when water is detected outside the tank or pipes.

3. **Energy Management**:
    - Track power usage in real-time with the `electrical_power` channel.
    - Use the `electrical_energy` channel for long-term energy consumption analysis and cost optimization.

## Developer Notes

1. **Channel Implementation**:
    - Implement all required channels for core water heating functionality.
    - Add optional channels for energy monitoring and leak detection based on device capabilities.

2. **Integration**:
    - Ensure the `heater` channel is mapped to the water heating control mechanisms.
    - Include the `device_information` channel for proper device identification.

3. **Safety Features**:
    - Implement the `leak` channel to provide early warning of potential water damage.
    - Consider integrating with home automation systems for automatic shutoff capabilities.

4. **Energy Tracking**:
    - Use `electrical_energy` and `electrical_power` channels to provide energy efficiency metrics.
    - Water heaters are significant energy consumers, making energy tracking valuable for users.
