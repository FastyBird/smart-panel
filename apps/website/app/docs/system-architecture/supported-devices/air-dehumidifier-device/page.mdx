## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the air dehumidifier:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `dehumidifier` | Controls the dehumidifier, including on/off state, target humidity, and operating modes. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/dehumidifier-channel) |
| `humidity` | Measures the relative humidity in the environment, reported as a percentage. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/humidity-channel) |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, including manufacturer details, model information, and operational statuses. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

---

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `fan` | Controls fan devices, including speed, oscillation, and modes for air circulation. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/fan-channel) |
| `electrical_energy` | Measures the total energy consumption over time, typically reported in kilowatt-hours (kWh). | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-energy-channel) |
| `electrical_power` | Reports real-time power metrics such as voltage, current, and wattage for monitoring and diagnostics. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-power-channel) |
| `leak` | Identifies the presence of water or other liquids to detect leaks and prevent damage. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/leak-channel) |
| `temperature` | Measures the current temperature in an environment, reported in degrees Celsius. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/temperature-channel) |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Humidity Control**:
    - Set target humidity levels and operating modes using the dehumidifier channel. Monitor current humidity with the humidity channel.

2. **Environmental Awareness**:
    - Track room temperature and detect potential water leaks for comprehensive environmental monitoring.

3. **Energy Tracking**:
    - Monitor power consumption and energy usage over time for efficiency analysis.

## Developer Notes

1. The dehumidifier and humidity channels are required for core functionality.
2. Optional fan channel allows independent fan speed control.
3. Leak detection is recommended for environments with high moisture levels.
