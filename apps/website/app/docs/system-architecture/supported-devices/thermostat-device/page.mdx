# Thermostat Device

<Callout type="info">
	**Device Category**: `thermostat`
</Callout>

The Thermostat device represents a climate control system that monitors and adjusts temperature and related environmental factors.

## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the thermostat:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `temperature` | Measures the current temperature in an environment, reported in degrees Celsius. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/temperature-channel) |
| `thermostat` | Manages climate control systems, allowing adjustments of heating, cooling, and fan settings. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/thermostat-channel) |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, including manufacturer details, model information, and operational statuses. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

---

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel** | **Description** | **Multiple** | **Details** |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| `contact` | Tracks the open or closed state of a contact point, such as a door, window, or cabinet. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/contact-channel) |
| `cooler` | Controls devices that lower air or liquid temperatures, such as air conditioners or refrigeration systems. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/cooler-channel) |
| `heater` | Manages heating devices, allowing control of temperature settings and modes. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/heater-channel) |
| `humidity` | Measures the relative humidity in the environment, reported as a percentage. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/humidity-channel) |
| `electrical_energy` | Measures the total energy consumption over time, typically reported in kilowatt-hours (kWh). | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-energy-channel) |
| `electrical_power` | Reports real-time power metrics such as voltage, current, and wattage for monitoring and diagnostics. | No | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-power-channel) |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Temperature Control**:
    - Set target temperatures and HVAC modes using the thermostat channel. Monitor current temperature with the temperature channel.

2. **Climate Scheduling**:
    - Configure heating and cooling schedules through thermostat modes (home, away, sleep, eco).

3. **Multi-Zone Control**:
    - Integrate with heater and cooler channels for precise zone-based climate management.

## Developer Notes

1. Temperature and thermostat channels are required for core functionality.
2. Optional heater/cooler channels provide direct control when supported.
3. Contact channel can be used for occupancy-based automation.
