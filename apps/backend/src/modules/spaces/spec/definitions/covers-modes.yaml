# Covers mode orchestration rules
# Defines how each covers mode affects window coverings by their role
#
# Design decisions:
# - OPEN mode: all covers fully open (100% position)
# - CLOSED mode: all covers fully closed (0% position)
# - PRIVACY mode: sheer at 50% for light diffusion, others open
# - DAYLIGHT mode: optimized positions for natural light while reducing glare
# - HIDDEN covers are always excluded from intent processing
