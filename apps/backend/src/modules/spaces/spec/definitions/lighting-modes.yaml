# Lighting mode orchestration rules
# Defines how each lighting mode affects lights by their role
#
# Design decisions:
# - WORK mode: main/task at 100%, ambient/accent OFF (not low - cleaner behavior)
# - RELAX mode: main/ambient at 50%, task OFF (not low - cleaner behavior)
# - NIGHT mode: night lights at 20%, fallback to main at 20% if no night lights; others OFF
# - OTHER role is treated as ambient for relax mode, off for work mode
# - Brightness delta applies to all currently ON lights (active set approach)
# - HIDDEN lights are always excluded from intent processing
