# Zigbee2MQTT Remote Control and Button Mappings
# Handles remote controls, buttons, and devices with action/click events

version: "1.0"

# DISABLED: All remote/button mappings are commented out because:
# - They use GENERIC category which is only a fallback and not used by the system
# - Button events (push, click, double click, hold, etc.) are not supported by Smart Panel
# Enable when event-based device support is added to the spec.
