guidelines:
  - Always respect existing architecture (NestJS modules, Vue structure, Flutter widgets).
  - Avoid suggesting large refactors unless explicitly asked.
  - Only focus on the files in the diff.
  - Never modify generated files (OpenAPI generated types, swagger parser output, etc.).
  - Encourage adding or expanding tests when new logic is added.
  - Avoid adding new dependencies unless there is a clear benefit.

severity:
  critical:
    - Security vulnerabilities (auth, tokens, session handling, secrets).
    - Incorrect usage of async / promises / observables that can lead to data loss or crashes.
    - Broken state handling (Pinia, Vue reactivity, Flutter stateful widgets).
    - DTO / API type mismatches that can break communication with the backend.
  major:
    - Missing validation or edge-case handling.
    - Misconfigured dependency injection.
    - Incorrect error handling that hides real problems.
  minor:
    - Naming inconsistencies.
    - Readability / maintainability issues.
    - Non-critical performance issues.
