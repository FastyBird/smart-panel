# Welcome to the FastyBird Smart Panel 👋

Looking to build your own smart home display? You're in the right place.

The **FastyBird Smart Panel** turns a simple screen — like a Raspberry Pi with a touchscreen — into a powerful, good-looking dashboard for your smart home. Control lights, monitor sensors, check temperatures, trigger automations… all from one place.

No need to be a programmer. If you know how to follow instructions, you can set this up.

## 🧠 What is it?

The Smart Panel is a customizable touchscreen interface built with Flutter and powered by the FastyBird IoT platform. It’s designed to give you:

- A modern UI for your smart home
- Real-time updates from devices
- Integration with platforms like Home Assistant
- Full control without relying on cloud services

And yes — it works completely offline, too.

## 🛠️ Who is this for?

This project is perfect for:

- 🏠 Smart home hobbyists
- 🧰 DIYers building their own control panels
- 💡 People who want a wall-mounted dashboard
- 🔌 Anyone using Home Assistant, Shelly, or Zigbee2MQTT

Whether you’re flashing your first SD card or you’ve automated your whole house — this is for you.
