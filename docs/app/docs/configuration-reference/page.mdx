# Configuration Reference

This page provides a comprehensive overview of the Smart Panel's configuration options using the `config.yaml` file. This file defines system-wide settings for audio, display behavior, language, weather integration, and plugin-specific configurations.

---

## Audio

Controls built-in speaker and microphone functionality.

```yaml
audio:
  speaker: true             # Enable or disable speaker output
  speaker_volume: 90        # Volume level from 0 to 100
  microphone: true          # Enable or disable microphone input
  microphone_volume: 10     # Volume level from 0 to 100
```

---

## Display

Controls display appearance and screen saver behavior.

```yaml
display:
  dark_mode: true               # Enables dark mode for the UI
  brightness: 80                # Screen brightness (0 to 100)
  screen_lock_duration: 60      # Time (in seconds) before screen lock activates
  screen_saver: true            # Enables screen saver mode after inactivity
```

## Language

Defines language, time zone, and time format.

```yaml
language:
  language: en_US           # Language locale (e.g., en_US, cs_CZ)
  timezone: Europe/Prague   # IANA timezone string
  time_format: 24h          # 12h or 24h display format
```

## Weather

Sets up weather data for the dashboard tiles. Uses the OpenWeather API.

```yaml

  location: null                   # City name or coordinates (e.g., Prague or 50.08804,14.42076)
  location_type: city_name         # 'lat_lon', 'city_name', 'city_id' or 'zip_code'
  unit: celsius                    # 'celsius' or 'fahrenheit'
  open_weather_api_key: your-key   # API key from OpenWeather
```

<Callout type="info">
	Weather data is used by the Weather Tile Plugin.
</Callout>

## Plugins

Contains configuration for individual plugin modules.

### Home Assistant Plugin

```yaml
plugins:
  devices-home-assistant-plugin:
    api_key: xxx                      # Long-lived access token
    hostname: 10.10.0.45:8123         # Hostname or IP of the Home Assistant instance
```

<Callout type="info">
