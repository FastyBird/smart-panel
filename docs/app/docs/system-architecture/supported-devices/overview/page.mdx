## What’s Next?

Now that you know which device types are supported, take a look at the Supported Channels to learn how each device communicates
with the Smart Panel.

Each device relies on one or more channels to control and monitor key aspects — from power state to temperature or media input.
Understanding channels is key to building a responsive and customizable interface.
