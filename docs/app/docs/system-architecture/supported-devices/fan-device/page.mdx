## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the fan:

| **Channel**          | **Description**                                                                | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `fan`                | Manages the fan's operation, including speed, direction, and activation.       | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/fan-channel)                |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, such as manufacturer, model, and firmware. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

---

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel**         | **Description**                             | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                           |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `electrical_energy` | Tracks total energy consumption over time.  | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-energy-channel) |
| `electrical_power`  | Provides real-time power usage information. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-power-channel)  |

---

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Fan Operation and Control**:
    - Activate or deactivate the fan using the `fan` channel.
    - Adjust speed and direction settings through the `fan` channel.

2. **Energy Monitoring**:
    - Use the `electrical_power` channel to monitor real-time power usage.
    - Track long-term energy consumption with the `electrical_energy` channel.

## Developer Notes

1. **Channel Implementation**:
    - Implement all required channels for core fan functionality.
    - Add optional channels for energy monitoring if the fan supports these features.

2. **Integration**:
    - Map the `fan` channel to the fan's speed and direction control mechanisms.
    - Include the `device_information` channel for device identification.

3. **Energy Tracking**:
    - Use the `electrical_energy` and `electrical_power` channels to enhance energy efficiency features.

4. **Use Cases**:
    - Suitable for standalone fans, ceiling fans, or integrated HVAC systems.
    - Provides energy management capabilities when combined with optional channels.
