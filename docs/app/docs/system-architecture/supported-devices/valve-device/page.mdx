## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the valve device:

| **Channel**          | **Description**                                                                | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `valve`              | Controls the open/close state and operation of the valve.                      | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/valve-channel)              |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, such as manufacturer, model, and firmware. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel**         | **Description**                                                         | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                           |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `battery`           | Monitors the battery status, if the valve is battery-powered.           | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/battery-channel)           |
| `electrical_energy` | Tracks total energy consumption over time.                              | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-energy-channel) |
| `electrical_power`  | Provides real-time power usage information.                             | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-power-channel)  |
| `flow`              | Monitors the flow rate through the valve.                               | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/flow-channel)              |
| `leak`              | Detects leaks or other flow-related issues.                             | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/leak-channel)              |
| `pressure`          | Monitors the pressure level in the system where the valve is installed. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/pressure-channel)          |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Flow Control**:
    - Open or close the valve using the `valve` channel.
    - Monitor flow rate with the `flow` channel for precision control.

2. **Energy Monitoring**:
    - Track power usage and energy consumption using the `electrical_power` and `electrical_energy` channels.

3. **System Safety**:
    - Use the `leak` channel to detect potential issues and ensure system integrity.
    - Monitor pressure levels through the `pressure` channel to prevent overloading.

4. **Battery Management**:
    - For battery-powered valves, monitor battery status using the `battery` channel.

## Developer Notes

1. **Channel Implementation**:
    - The `device_information` and `valve` channels are mandatory for basic valve operation.
    - Implement optional channels to provide advanced features like flow rate monitoring or energy management.

2. **Integration**:
    - Ensure seamless operation with other system components using the `flow` and `pressure` channels.

3. **Extensibility**:
    - Add leak detection and energy tracking features using the `leak`, `electrical_energy`, and `electrical_power` channels as needed.
