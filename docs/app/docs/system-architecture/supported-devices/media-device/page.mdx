## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the media device:

| **Channel**          | **Description**                                                                | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `media_input`        | Manages the input sources for audio or video playback.                         | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/media-input-channel)        |
| `media_playback`     | Controls playback actions such as play, pause, stop, and seek.                 | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/media-playback-channel)     |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, such as manufacturer, model, and firmware. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Multimedia Playback**:
    - Use the `mediaInput` channel to select and configure input sources (e.g., HDMI, USB, or streaming services).
    - Control playback actions (e.g., play, pause, or seek) through the `mediaPlayback` channel.

2. **Audio Communication**:
    - Utilize the `microphone` channel for voice commands or audio input.
    - Manage speaker settings and output volume via the `speaker` channel.

3. **Device Metadata**:
    - Access device-specific information such as model and firmware using the `device_information` channel.

## Developer Notes

1. **Channel Implementation**:
    - Implement all required channels for core media playback and control functionality.
    - Add optional channels to support audio recording or advanced sound output features.

2. **Integration**:
    - Ensure the `mediaInput` and `mediaPlayback` channels are linked to the device's input and playback components.
    - Include the `device_information` channel for proper device identification.

3. **Extensibility**:
    - Optional channels like `microphone` and `speaker` can enhance the media device's utility for communication or high-quality audio output.
