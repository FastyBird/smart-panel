## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel**         | **Description**                                                                                    | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                           |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `contact`           | Detects the state of doors or windows to improve energy efficiency by pausing operation when open. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/contact-channel)           |
| `cooler`            | Adds cooling functionality to the thermostat.                                                      | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/cooler-channel)            |
| `heater`            | Adds heating functionality to the thermostat.                                                      | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/heater-channel)            |
| `humidity`          | Monitors and displays the ambient humidity level.                                                  | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/humidity-channel)          |
| `electrical_energy` | Tracks total energy consumption over time.                                                         | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-energy-channel) |
| `electrical_power`  | Provides real-time power usage information.                                                        | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-power-channel)  |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Temperature Control**:
    - Set a target temperature via the `temperature` and `thermostat` channels.
    - Monitor the current room temperature using the `temperature` channel.

2. **Energy Efficiency**:
    - Use the `contact` channel to detect open windows or doors and adjust operations accordingly.

3. **Climate Control**:
    - Enable cooling or heating functionalities via the `cooler` or `heater` channels.
    - Monitor and optimize humidity levels using the `humidity` channel.

## Developer Notes

1. **Channel Implementation**:
    - Ensure the `device_information`, `temperature`, and `thermostat` channels are implemented for basic thermostat functionality.

2. **Integration**:
    - The `contact` channel can be used to improve energy efficiency by integrating door or window state detection.

3. **Extensibility**:
    - Add cooling or heating capabilities with the `cooler` or `heater` channels as needed.
    - Monitor humidity levels for more advanced climate control.
