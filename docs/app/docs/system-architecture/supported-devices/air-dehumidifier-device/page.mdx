## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the air dehumidifier:

| **Channel**          | **Description**                                                                | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `cooler`             | Controls the cooling functionality of the dehumidifier.                        | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/cooler-channel)             |
| `humidity`           | Monitors the ambient humidity level and controls target humidity settings.     | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/humidity-channel)           |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, such as manufacturer, model, and firmware. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel**         | **Description**                                      | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                           |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `electrical_energy` | Tracks total energy consumption over time.           | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-energy-channel) |
| `electrical_power`  | Provides real-time power usage information.          | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-power-channel)  |
| `fan`               | Manages fan settings, including speed and direction. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/fan-channel)               |
| `leak`              | Detects water leaks or other potential issues.       | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/leak-channel)              |
| `temperature`       | Monitors the ambient temperature.                    | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/temperature-channel)       |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Dehumidification Control**:
    - Adjust humidity levels using the `humidity` channel.
    - Enhance performance with `cooler` and optional `fan` channels.

2. **Environmental Monitoring**:
    - Monitor room humidity (`humidity`) and temperature (`temperature`) for optimal comfort.
    - Detect leaks using the `leak` channel for safety.

3. **Energy Management**:
    - Track power usage and energy consumption using the `electrical_power` and `electrical_energy` channels.

## Developer Notes

1. **Channel Implementation**:
    - Implement all required channels for core dehumidification functionality.
    - Add optional channels based on the specific features of the device.

2. **Integration**:
    - Ensure proper mapping of channels to the device's physical or logical components.
    - The `device_information` channel is mandatory for device identification.

3. **Energy and Safety Monitoring**:
    - Include `electrical_energy` and `electrical_power` for energy efficiency tracking.
    - Use the `leak` channel for enhanced safety in environments prone to water-related issues.

4. **Extensibility**:
    - Add optional channels like `temperature` or `fan` to support additional features.
    - Use the `humidity` and `cooler` channels to manage environmental conditions effectively.
