## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the robot vacuum device:

| **Channel**          | **Description**                                                                | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `battery`            | Monitors the battery level and status of the robot vacuum.                     | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/battery-channel)            |
| `robot_vacuum`       | Manages the operational state and cleaning modes of the robot vacuum.          | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/robotic-vacuum-channel)     |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, such as manufacturer, model, and firmware. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

---

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel**         | **Description**                                  | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                           |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `electrical_energy` | Tracks total energy consumption over time.       | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-energy-channel) |
| `electrical_power`  | Provides real-time power usage information.      | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-power-channel)  |
| `leak`              | Detects leaks or potential issues in the vacuum. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/leak-channel)              |
