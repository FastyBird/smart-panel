## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the window covering device:

| **Channel**          | **Description**                                                                | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `window_covering`    | Controls the position, tilt, and operational state of the window covering.     | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/window-covering-channel)    |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, such as manufacturer, model, and firmware. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

---

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel**         | **Description**                                                         | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                           |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `battery`           | Monitors the battery status, if the window covering is battery-powered. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/battery-channel)           |
| `electrical_energy` | Tracks total energy consumption over time.                              | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-energy-channel) |
| `electrical_power`  | Provides real-time power usage information.                             | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-power-channel)  |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Automation and Control**:
    - Adjust the position and tilt of the window covering using the `windowCovering` channel.

2. **Energy Management**:
    - Monitor power usage and energy consumption with the `electrical_power` and `electrical_energy` channels.

3. **Battery Monitoring**:
    - For battery-powered window coverings, track battery status using the `battery` channel.

## Developer Notes

1. **Channel Implementation**:
    - The `device_information` and `windowCovering` channels are required for basic operation.
    - Include optional channels for advanced features like energy tracking or battery monitoring.

2. **Integration**:
    - Ensure seamless operation in automated home systems by implementing required and relevant optional channels.

3. **Extensibility**:
    - Add power monitoring features using `electrical_energy` and `electrical_power` as needed.
    - For battery-operated systems, the `battery` channel provides critical status information.
