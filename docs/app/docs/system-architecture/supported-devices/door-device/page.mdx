## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the door:

| **Channel**          | **Description**                                                                | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `door`               | Controls and monitors the opening, closing, and status of the door.            | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/doorbell-channel)           |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, such as manufacturer, model, and firmware. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel** | **Description**                                                               | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                 |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `battery`   | Monitors the battery level and status, if the door system is battery-powered. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/battery-channel) |
| `contact`   | Detects the opening or closing of the door.                                   | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/contact-channel) |
| `lock`      | Monitors or controls the lock mechanism for the door.                         | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/lock-channel)    |
| `motion`    | Detects motion near the door for enhanced security.                           | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/motion-channel)  |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Door Control and Monitoring**:
    - Open, close, or monitor the door's status using the `door` channel.
    - Detect door activity through the `contact` channel for security purposes.

2. **Security and Safety**:
    - Use the `lock` channel to integrate locking mechanisms with automated door systems.
    - Detect motion near the door using the `motion` channel for enhanced situational awareness.

3. **Battery and Energy Monitoring**:
    - Monitor the battery status via the `battery` channel for wireless door systems.

## Developer Notes

1. **Channel Implementation**:
    - Implement all required channels for core door functionality.
    - Add optional channels based on the specific features of the door device.

2. **Integration**:
    - Ensure proper mapping of channels to the door's physical or logical components.
    - The `device_information` channel is mandatory for device identification.

3. **Extensibility**:
    - Use the `motion` channel for motion detection capabilities.
    - Add the `lock` channel for doors that support locking mechanisms.

4. **Use Cases**:
    - Suitable for garage doors, entrance doors, or any automated or monitored door systems.
    - Integrate additional features like `battery` monitoring for standalone or wireless doors.
