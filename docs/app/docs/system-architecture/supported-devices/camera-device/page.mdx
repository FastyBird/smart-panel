|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `camera`             | Provides video and image data streams from the camera.                         | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/camera-channel)             |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, such as manufacturer, model, and firmware. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel**   | **Description**                                                          | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                     |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `battery`     | Monitors the battery level and status, if the camera is battery-powered. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/battery-channel)     |
| `contact`     | Detects the opening or closing of associated contact points.             | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/contact-channel)     |
| `humidity`    | Monitors the ambient humidity level around the camera.                   | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/humidity-channel)    |
| `light`       | Controls or monitors lighting features associated with the camera.       | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/light-channel)       |
| `microphone`  | Captures audio input for the camera.                                     | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/microphone-channel)  |
| `motion`      | Detects motion in the camera's field of view.                            | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/motion-channel)      |
| `speaker`     | Outputs audio from the camera for communication or alerts.               | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/speaker-channel)     |
| `temperature` | Monitors the ambient temperature around the camera.                      | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/temperature-channel) |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Surveillance and Monitoring**:
    - Stream video and capture images using the `camera` channel.
    - Detect motion through the `motion` channel for event-based recording.

2. **Audio Interaction**:
    - Enable two-way communication using the `microphone` and `speaker` channels.
    - Capture environmental audio for enhanced monitoring.

3. **Environmental Monitoring**:
    - Track temperature (`temperature`) and humidity (`humidity`) for situational awareness.
    - Monitor lighting conditions or control built-in lights via the `light` channel.

4. **Battery and Security Features**:
    - Monitor battery status using the `battery` channel for wireless cameras.
    - Use the `contact` channel to monitor associated doors or windows for security integration.

## Developer Notes

1. **Channel Implementation**:
    - Implement all required channels for core camera functionality.
    - Add optional channels based on the specific features of the camera device.

2. **Integration**:
    - Ensure proper mapping of channels to the camera's physical or logical components.
    - The `device_information` channel is mandatory for device identification.

3. **Extensibility**:
    - Include channels like `microphone` and `speaker` for two-way audio capabilities.
    - Use environmental channels like `humidity` and `temperature` for enhanced situational monitoring.

4. **Event-Based Monitoring**:
    - Use the `motion` channel to trigger recordings or alerts.
    - Integrate the `contact` channel for security scenarios like monitoring doors and windows.
