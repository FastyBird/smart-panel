## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the sprinkler device:

| **Channel**          | **Description**                                                                | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `valve`              | Controls the water flow through the sprinkler system.                          | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/valve-channel)              |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, such as manufacturer, model, and firmware. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel**         | **Description**                                                      | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                           |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `electrical_energy` | Tracks total energy consumption over time.                           | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-energy-channel) |
| `electrical_power`  | Provides real-time power usage information.                          | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/electrical-power-channel)  |
| `flow`              | Monitors the water flow rate in the sprinkler system.                | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/flow-channel)              |
| `humidity`          | Measures the ambient humidity level to optimize watering schedules.  | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/humidity-channel)          |
| `leak`              | Detects water leaks to prevent waste and damage.                     | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/leak-channel)              |
| `pressure`          | Monitors water pressure to ensure proper operation of the sprinkler. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/pressure-channel)          |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Irrigation Control**:
    - Use the `valve` channel to start, stop, or adjust water flow through the sprinkler system.

2. **Environmental Monitoring**:
    - Measure ambient humidity with the `humidity` channel to determine if watering is needed.
    - Monitor water pressure and flow using the `pressure` and `flow` channels to maintain efficient irrigation.

3. **Energy and Safety Monitoring**:
    - Track energy consumption and real-time power usage using the `electrical_energy` and `electrical_power` channels.
    - Detect leaks with the `leak` channel to prevent water wastage and potential damage.

## Developer Notes

1. **Channel Implementation**:
    - Ensure the `device_information` and `valve` channels are implemented for core irrigation functionality.

2. **Integration**:
    - Optional channels like `humidity` and `flow` can be added to enhance the system's environmental monitoring capabilities.

3. **Extensibility**:
    - Use the `electrical_energy` and `electrical_power` channels to provide energy tracking features.
    - The `leak` and `pressure` channels improve safety and system reliability.
