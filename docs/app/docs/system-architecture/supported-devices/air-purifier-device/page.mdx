## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Air Purification**:
    - Adjust fan settings to control air circulation using the `fan` channel.
    - Monitor particulate matter (`airParticulate`) to maintain air quality.

2. **Environmental Monitoring**:
    - Track temperature (`temperature`) and humidity (`humidity`) for optimal indoor comfort.
    - Detect harmful gases like CO₂, CO, and VOCs using the respective channels.

3. **Health and Safety**:
    - Use `leak` to detect water leaks or device malfunctions.
    - Monitor atmospheric pressure (`pressure`) and gas concentrations (e.g., NO₂, SO₂) for comprehensive air quality analysis.
