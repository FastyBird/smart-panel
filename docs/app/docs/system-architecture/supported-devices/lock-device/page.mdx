## Required Channels

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the lock device:

| **Channel**          | **Description**                                                                | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `lock`               | Controls the locking and unlocking functionality of the device.                | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/lock-channel)               |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, such as manufacturer, model, and firmware. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/device-information-channel) |

---

## Optional Channels

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel** | **Description**                                             | **Multiple** | **Details**                                                                 |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `battery`   | Monitors the battery level and status of the lock.          | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/battery-channel) |
| `contact`   | Detects whether the door or access point is closed or open. | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/contact-channel) |
| `motion`    | Detects motion near the lock for enhanced security.         | No           | [See details](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/motion-channel)  |

## Use Case Scenarios

1. **Access Control**:
    - Lock or unlock the device using the `lock` channel.
    - Monitor the current lock state through the same channel.

2. **Battery Monitoring**:
    - Keep track of the lock's battery status using the `battery` channel to avoid power-related issues.

3. **Security Monitoring**:
    - Detect door or access point status with the `contact` channel.
    - Use the `motion` channel for added security by monitoring nearby motion.

## Developer Notes

1. **Channel Implementation**:
    - Implement all required channels to ensure core locking functionality.
    - Add optional channels for advanced monitoring and security features.

2. **Integration**:
    - Ensure the `lock` channel is mapped to the physical or logical locking mechanism.
    - Include the `device_information` channel for proper device identification.

3. **Power Management**:
    - Use the `battery` channel to provide feedback on power levels, particularly for battery-powered locks.

4. **Security Enhancements**:
    - Utilize the `contact` and `motion` channels to enhance the lock's utility in security applications.
