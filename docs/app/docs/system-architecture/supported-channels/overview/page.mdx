# Supported Channels

This page provides an overview of all supported **channel types** in the Smart Panel system. Each channel defines a specific
function — from temperature control to motion detection — and is used across many different devices.

<Callout type="info">
	Channels are **modular** and **reusable** building blocks that define what a device can measure or control.
</Callout>

## Overview

Channels represent **specific features** or **data points** on a device — like a light’s brightness, a sensor’s motion
detection, or a speaker’s volume control. These building blocks make it easy to define devices consistently and extend
functionality through plugins or configuration.

## What’s Next?

Now that you’ve explored the available channels, you’ll start to see how devices are composed from these building blocks.

Each channel brings specific functionality — from turning on lights to tracking air quality. Understanding them is essential
for designing responsive devices and dashboards.
