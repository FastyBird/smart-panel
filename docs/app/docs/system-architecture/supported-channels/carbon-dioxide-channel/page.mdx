# Carbon Dioxide Sensor Channel

<Callout type="info">
	**Channel Category**: `carbon_dioxide`
</Callout>

Monitors CO₂ levels in the environment to track air quality and ventilation efficiency.

## Required Properties

| **Property** | **Data Type** | **Range**       | **Unit** | **Permissions** |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|----------|-----------------|
| `detected`   | `Bool`        | `true/false`    | -        | RO (Read-Only)  |
| `density`    | `Float`       | `0.0–100,000.0` | ppm      | RO (Read-Only)  |

---

### Property Details

#### `detected`

Indicates whether the sensor detects abnormal levels of carbon dioxide:

- `true`: Abnormal CO₂ levels detected.
- `false`: CO₂ levels have returned to normal.

#### `density`

Reports the current detected carbon dioxide (CO₂) level in parts per million (ppm).

> [!Notes]:
Either `detected` or `density` must be included, depending on the use case. If only `density` is provided, values
of **800 ppm** or higher are generally considered poor air quality and will be displayed as a warning.

## Optional Properties

| **Property**  | **Data Type** | **Range**       | **Unit** | **Permissions** |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------|----------|-----------------|
| `peak_level`  | `Float`       | `0.0–100,000.0` | ppm      | RO (Read-Only)  |
| `active`      | `Bool`        | `true/false`    | -        | RO (Read-Only)  |
| `fault`       | `Uchar`       | `0–255`         | -        | RO (Read-Only)  |
| `tampered`    | `Bool`        | `true/false`    | -        | RO (Read-Only)  |

---

### Property Details

#### `peak_level`

Indicates the highest carbon dioxide (CO₂) level detected by the sensor, in parts per million (ppm).

#### `active`

Indicates the channel's current working status:

- `true`: The sensor is active and functioning correctly.
- `false`: The sensor is inactive or non-functional.

#### `fault`

Represents the fault state of the sensor:

- `0`: No fault detected.
- Non-zero: A fault has been detected, potentially affecting functionality.

#### `tampered`

Indicates whether the channel has been tampered with:

- `true`: The channel has been tampered with.
- `false`: The channel is in a normal, non-tampered state.
