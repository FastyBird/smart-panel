# Ozone Sensor Channel

<Callout type="info">
	**Channel Category**: `ozone`
</Callout>

Measures ozone (O₃) levels in the air, often used in environmental quality assessments.

## Required Properties

| **Property** | **Data Type** | **Range**         | **Unit** | **Permissions** |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|----------|-----------------|
| `detected`   | `Bool`        | `true/false`      | -        | RO (Read-Only)  |
| `density`    | `Float`       | `0.0–100,000.0`   | µg/m³    | RO (Read-Only)  |
| `level`      | `Enum`        | `low/medium/high` | -        | RO (Read-Only)  |

---

### Property Details

#### `detected`

Indicates whether the sensor detects abnormal ozone (O₃) levels:

- `true`: Abnormal ozone levels detected.
- `false`: Ozone levels are within normal limits.

#### `density`

Reports the current ozone concentration:

- Measured in micrograms per cubic meter (`µg/m³`).
- Reflects the real-time level of ozone in the environment.

#### `level`

Provides a qualitative assessment of the ozone levels:

- Possible values:
    - `low`: Safe ozone levels.
    - `medium`: Moderate ozone levels that may require attention.
    - `high`: High ozone levels, potentially hazardous to health.
- The `level` property will be mapped to specific `density` ranges for better interpretation:
    - `low`: `0–100 µg/m³`
    - `medium`: `101–200 µg/m³`
    - `high`: `>200 µg/m³`

> [!Notes]:
At least one of the required properties (`detected`, `density`, or `level`) must be present. Additionally, either
`density` or `level` can be provided, but not both simultaneously.

## Optional Properties

| **Property** | **Data Type** | **Range**    | **Unit** | **Permissions** |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| `active`     | `Bool`        | `true/false` | -        | RO (Read-Only)  |
| `fault`      | `Uchar`       | `0–255`      | -        | RO (Read-Only)  |
| `tampered`   | `Bool`        | `true/false` | -        | RO (Read-Only)  |

---

### Property Details

#### `active`

Indicates the channel's current working status:

- `true`: The sensor is active and functioning correctly.
- `false`: The sensor is inactive or non-functional.

#### `fault`

Represents the fault state of the sensor:

- `0`: No fault detected.
- Non-zero: A fault has been detected, potentially affecting functionality.

#### `tampered`

Indicates whether the channel has been tampered with:

- `true`: The channel has been tampered with.
- `false`: The channel is in a normal, non-tampered state.
