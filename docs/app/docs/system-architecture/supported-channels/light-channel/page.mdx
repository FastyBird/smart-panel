### Property Details

#### `brightness`

Represents the perceived level of brightness:

- Expressed as a percentage (`0–100%`) of the maximum supported brightness.

#### `color_red`, `color_green`, `color_blue`

Define the RGB color values:

- Must be defined together for accurate color selection.

#### `color_white`

Represents the intensity of white light in the RGB spectrum.

#### `color_temperature`

Describes the color temperature of the light:

- Measured in Kelvin (`K`).
- Range: `2,700–6,500` Kelvin.

#### `hue`

Represents the hue or shade of color:

- Range: `0–360` degrees on the color wheel.

#### `saturation`

Indicates the color saturation:

- Expressed as a percentage (`0–100%`).

> [!Notes]:
The `color_red`, `color_green`, and `color_blue` properties must be defined together to set the RGB color accurately.
This channel also supports hue and saturation. Both `hue` and `saturation` must be configured together for proper operation.
