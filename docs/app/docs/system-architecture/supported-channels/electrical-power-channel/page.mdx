### Property Details

#### `voltage`

Indicates the voltage supplied to the device:

- Measured in volts (`V`).
- Example: `230` indicates the device is operating at 230 V.

#### `current`

Indicates the current flowing through the device:

- Measured in amperes (`A`).
- Example: `2.5` means the device is drawing 2.5 A.

#### `frequency`

Represents the frequency of the power supply:

- Measured in hertz (`Hz`).
- Typically `50` or `60` Hz depending on the region.

#### `over_current`

Indicates whether an overcurrent condition is detected:

- `true`: Overcurrent detected.
- `false`: No overcurrent.

#### `over_voltage`

Indicates whether an overvoltage condition is detected:

- `true`: Overvoltage detected.
- `false`: No overvoltage.

#### `over_power`

Indicates whether an overpowered condition is detected:

- `true`: Overpower detected.
- `false`: No overpower.

#### `active`

Indicates the channel's current working status:

- `true`: The sensor is active and functioning correctly.
- `false`: The sensor is inactive or non-functional.

#### `fault`

Represents the fault state of the sensor:

- `0`: No fault detected.
- Non-zero: A fault has been detected, potentially affecting functionality.
