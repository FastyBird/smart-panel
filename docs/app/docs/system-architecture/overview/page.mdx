# System Architecture Overview

The **System Architecture** section offers a high-level understanding of how the Smart Panel organizes and interacts with
devices and their capabilities. This virtual structure ensures that a wide variety of hardware can be integrated consistently,
regardless of brand or protocol.

By breaking down physical or virtual devices into abstracted models â€” such as *devices*, *channels*, and *properties* â€” the platform
can offer robust customization, clear structure, and future-proof extensibility.

## Devices

A **device** is a representation of a real-world object â€” for example, a light bulb, a sensor, a speaker, or a thermostat. Each device:

- Belongs to a **category** (e.g., lighting, heating, media)
- Has a **unique name and identifier**
- Contains one or more **channels** that define its capabilities

This abstraction allows the system to treat all devices uniformly, even if they originate from different ecosystems (e.g., Zigbee, MQTT, HomeKit).

---

## Channels

A **channel** encapsulates a specific feature or functionality of a device. For example:

- A light device may have a **brightness** and **color** channel
- A thermostat may include a **temperature** and **humidity** channel
- A speaker may include a **volume** and **playback** channel

This modular design allows capabilities to be reused across device categories and makes the interface predictable and scalable.

## Purpose

The goal of this section is to document how devices and channels are modeled in the Smart Panel ecosystem. This structure is essential for:

- Developers building custom integrations or plugins
- Users configure devices manually through the Admin interface
- Contributors who want to expand supported device types

You donâ€™t need to be a developer to benefit from this overview â€” just a curious mind and a desire to customize your smart home.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Now that you understand how the Smart Panel structures **devices** and **channels**, it's time to dive into the actual components.

ðŸ‘‰ Head over to the **[Supported Devices](/docs/system-architecture/supported-devices)** section to explore each device category and its associated capabilities.
