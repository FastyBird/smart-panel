# API Reference

FastyBird Smart Panel offers a robust, RESTful API that allows you to integrate, extend, and control the system programmatically.

## About the API

The Smart Panel API exposes endpoints for managing:

- Devices, channels, and properties
- Pages, tiles, and dashboards
- Configuration and system settings
- Third-party device integrations

It is designed to be:

- ✅ Open and well-documented
- ✅ Schema-first, built on OpenAPI
- ✅ Fully compatible with third-party and custom integrations

The full API documentation is available and maintained using **Stoplight**, where you can explore endpoints, test requests, and inspect schemas.

## Authentication

All requests to protected endpoints must include a valid API key or token, depending on the type of client integration:

- **Display App** connects over WebSocket without credentials (auto-authenticated via registration)
- **Third-party Devices** use static tokens and authenticated callbacks
- **Admin App** communicates with the backend over HTTP and WebSocket via trusted connection

## API Clients

You can use any HTTP client to interact with the API (like `axios`, `curl`, Postman, etc.). OpenAPI tools such as [Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/) or [openapi-typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openapi-typescript) can be used to generate strong-typed clients.

If you're building an integration, custom plugin, or automation that communicates with the Smart Panel, this is your primary interface to the system.
