# Channels

Channels define what a device can **do** or **measure** â€” like turning a light on, reporting temperature, or adjusting
fan speed. Each device includes one or more channels based on its functionality.

---

## Add Channels to a Device

Once a device is created, you can assign channels to it. This enables specific controls and sensors for that device.

<Steps>
	### Select a Device

	In the **Devices** section of the Admin UI, click on the device you want to configure.

	This opens the detail view for the selected device.

	<p align="center">
		<img src="/images/devices-device-detail.png" alt="Device detail" />
	</p>

	---

	### Click **+ Add Channel**

	Click **+ Add Channel** in the top-right corner.

	This will open the channel creation dialog.

	<p align="center">
		<img src="/images/devices-add-channel.png" alt="Add new channel" />
	</p>

	---

	### Fill in Channel Details

	Enter the required information for the channel:

	- **Name** â€“ The name used internally (e.g., `light`, `temperature`, `valve`)
	- **Category** â€“ Choose from a list of supported channel types
	- **Description** *(optional)* â€“ Short description of the channel

</Steps>

<Callout>
	The channel category determines which properties can be used (like `power`, `brightness`, or `temperature`). Check the
	[**Supported Channels**](/docs/system-architecture/supported-channels/overview) reference for details.
</Callout>

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Youâ€™ve now structured your deviceâ€™s capabilities. Next up: define the **Properties** for each channel â€” these are the
individual controls or values.

ðŸ‘‰ Head to the [Properties](/docs/admin-management/properties) section.
