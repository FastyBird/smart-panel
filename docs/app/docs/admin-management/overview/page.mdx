# Managing Your Smart Panel

Your Smart Panel is more than just a display. Itâ€™s a powerful interface that lets you control, monitor, and customize
how your smart devices interact with your environment.

This section shows you how to manage everything from adding new devices to building beautiful dashboards with tiles and
data sources.

---

### What You Can Do Here

- Add and organize smart devices
- Build pages and dashboards with drag-and-drop tiles
- Connect devices to tiles through data sources
- Use plugins to sync devices from other platforms (like Home Assistant)

Whether youâ€™re starting from scratch or syncing existing smart devices, this section has you covered.

### Where This Happens

All of these actions are done through the **Admin Panel**, which runs on your Raspberry Pi and is accessible via a browser.

Just visit [http://smart-panel.local](http://smart-panel.local) or use your Piâ€™s IP address to access the panel.

<Callout>
	The domain `smart-panel.local` was configured during the installation process in the [**Get Started**](/docs/get-started/preparation#configure-advanced-options)
	section. You can use it to access the Admin UI from your browser on the same network.
</Callout>

Youâ€™ll see:

- A list of your **devices**
- A collection of **pages** and **tiles**
- Tools to configure your **system**, **plugins**, and more

### Tip

Use the Admin Panel to:

- Experiment with new layouts
- Group sensors and controls for a room
- Easily customize the user experience without needing to code
