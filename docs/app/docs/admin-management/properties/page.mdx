# Properties

Properties define the actual **data points** or **controls** inside a channel. This is where things like a lightâ€™s power
state, a thermostatâ€™s target temperature, or a sensorâ€™s battery level are configured.

Each channel can contain one or more properties depending on the device category and functionality.

## Add Properties to a Channel

After creating a channel, youâ€™ll assign properties to define what it measures or controls.

<Steps>
	### Open a Channel

	In the **Admin UI**, go to your device, switch to the **Channels** tab, and select a specific channel.

	<p align="center">
		<img src="/images/devices-channel-detail.png" alt="Channel detail" />
	</p>

	---

	### Click **+ Add Property**

	Click **+ Add Property** in the top-right corner.

	This will open the channel property creation dialog.

	<p align="center">
		<img src="/images/devices-channel-add-property.png" alt="Add new channel" />
	</p>

	---

	### Define the Property

	Fill in the required fields:

	- **Name** â€“ Internal identifier (e.g., `state`, `brightness`, `humidity`)
	- **Data Type** â€“ Type of value (`boolean`, `float`, `enum`, etc.)
	- **Unit** â€“ Optional unit of measurement (`Â°C`, `%`, `W`, etc.)
	- **Permissions** â€“ Define if itâ€™s readable, writable, or both
	- **Format** *(optional)* â€“ Additional structure (e.g., for enums)

	<Callout type="info">
		The form may vary depending on the selected channel category. In some cases, fields like data type or format are pre-filled
		by the system and cannot be changed manually.
	</Callout>
</Steps>

<Callout>
	The supported properties are based on the channelâ€™s category. For example, a `light` channel may use `power` and
	`brightness`, while a `temperature` channel uses `actual` and `target`.
</Callout>

## Whatâ€™s Next?

With your device, channels, and properties defined, itâ€™s time to visualize and control them on the display.
