# Pages

Pages define the layout of your Smart Panel interface. Each page acts as a container for **tiles**, **cards**, or **data sources**,
allowing you to group devices and information logically â€” by room, function, or display type.

---

## Add a New Page

<Steps>
	### Open the Admin UI

	Open the Admin Interface in your browser:

	```bash copy
	http://smart-panel.local
	```

	You'll land on the dashboard, where you can manage devices, pages, tiles, and data sources.

	---

	### Navigate to Pages

	Click **Pages** in the sidebar. This section lists all the pages currently configured for your Smart Panel display.

	<p align="center">
		<img src="/images/dashboard-pages-list.png" alt="List of configured pages" />
	</p>

	---

	### Click **+ Add**

	In the **Pages** section, click the **+ Add Page** button in the top-right corner to create a new page.

	<p align="center">
		<img src="/images/dashboard-pages-add.png" alt="Add new page" />
	</p>

	---

	### Fill in Page Details

	In the form, enter the following information:

	- **Plugin (Page Type)** â€“ Choose the layout plugin:
		- `Tiles Page` â€“ Displays a grid of interactive tiles (great for dashboards)
		- `Cards Page` â€“ Displays grouped device cards (compact overview layout)
		- `Device Detail Page` â€“ Displays a view for a specific device
	- **Title** â€“ Name of the page shown in the Admin and on the Smart Panel
	- **Icon** *(optional)* â€“ Assign a visual icon to help identify the page
	- **Order** â€“ Sets the order in which pages appear on the Smart Panel

	<Callout type="info">
		Currently, only the **Tiles Page**, **Device detail** and **Cards page** plugins are available. Other page types will
		be added in the future.
	</Callout>
</Steps>

## After Creating a Page

What you can do next depends on the page type:

- **Tiles Page**: Add **tiles** directly to the page in a flexible grid layout. Each tile represents a device control or data display.
- **Cards Page**: Organize **tiles** into **cards** (grouped blocks). Cards help visually structure related controls or data sources.
- **Device Detail Page**: This page is auto-generated and linked to a specific device. It shows all channels and properties and is not editable.

<Callout type="info">
	While Tiles and Cards pages support full customization via the Admin UI, Device Detail pages are system-generated.
</Callout>
