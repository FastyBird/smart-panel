# Tiles

Tiles represent the visual blocks on your Smart Panel screen — each tile displays data from a device or allows interaction, like toggling a switch or setting brightness.

Tiles are placed within **Tiles Pages** or **Cards Pages** and are linked to specific devices.

## Add Tiles to a Page

<Steps>
	### Open the Admin UI

	Open the Admin Interface:

	```bash copy
	http://smart-panel.local
	```

	Go to the **Pages** section to view your smart panel layouts.

	<p align="center">
		<img src="/images/dashboard-pages-list.png" alt="List of configured pages" />
	</p>

	### Click "Configure” on a Tiles Page

	In the list of created pages, locate a **Tiles Page** and click the **Configure** button next to it.

	This opens the tile layout editor where you can add or rearrange tiles.

	<p align="center">
		<img src="/images/dashboard-pages-configure.png" alt="Configure page layout" />
	</p>

	### Add a New Tile

	Click the **+** button in one of the empty grid areas to add a tile.

	A form will appear on the right side.

	<p align="center">
		<img src="/images/dashboard-tile-add.png" alt="Add tile to page" />
	</p>

	### Fill in Tile Details

	- Depending on the selected **tile plugin**, different configuration fields may appear.

	For example, you might be asked to:

	- Select a **device** the tile will represent
	- Choose how the tile should behave or what data it should show

	<Callout type="info">
		The system uses the selected tile plugin to generate the appropriate configuration form. Plugins may offer different
		options depending on their purpose.
	</Callout>

	After filling in the required information, click **Save** to add the tile to your layout.
</Steps>

### Rearranging or Removing Tiles

- You can drag and drop tiles to reposition them on the grid.
- To remove a tile, drag it into the red **"Drop here to remove”** box on the right side.

## After Adding Tiles

Once tiles are configured:

- **They will appear on your Smart Panel display** in the same layout as in the Admin UI.
- You can **revisit the configuration** at any time to rearrange or remove them.
- Tiles dynamically reflect the state of your devices and allow quick control actions.
