# Devices

Devices represent the core components of your smart home â€” such as lights, thermostats, sensors, or virtual integrations
like Home Assistant. Each device is made up of one or more **channels**, which define what the device can do or monitor.

## Add a New Device

<Steps>
	### Open the Admin UI

	Open the Admin Interface in your browser:

	```bash copy
	http://smart-panel.local
	```

	You'll see the dashboard where you can manage devices, channels, properties, and pages.

	## Navigate to Devices

	Click **Devices** in the sidebar. Here, youâ€™ll find a list of all currently connected or created devices.

	- You can **create** a device manually.
	- Or you can wait for an integration (like Home Assistant) to auto-discover devices.

	</p>

	### Click **+ Add**

	Navigate to the **Devices** section and click the **+ Add Device** button in the top-right corner.

	This will open the device creation dialog.

	</p>

	### Select Device Type (Plugin)

	Choose the source for the device â€” this defines how the panel communicates with it. For example:

	- **Third-party** for manually created devices
	- **Home Assistant** for devices synced from your HA setup
	- **Matter**, **Zigbee**, (will be added soon)

	---

	### Fill in Device Details

	Enter the basic information:

	- **Name** â€“ Friendly display name (e.g., *Living Room Lamp*)
	- **Description** *(optional)* â€“ A short note about the device
	- **Category** â€“ The device type, like *light*, *thermostat*, or *camera*

	<Callout>
		Device categories and their required channels are defined in the [**System Architecture**](/docs/system-architecture/overview) section. Each
		category defines the expected capabilities of the device.
	</Callout>
</Steps>

## After Creating a Device

Once your device is created, you can:

- **Add Channels**: Define which parts of the device you want to control or monitor.
- **Place It on a Page**: Use the **Pages** section to visualize the device on your display.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Now that youâ€™ve added a device, letâ€™s explore how to configure its **Channels**.

ðŸ‘‰ Head to the [Channels](/docs/admin-management/channels) section.
