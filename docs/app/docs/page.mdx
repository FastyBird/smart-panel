# Say Hello to Your Personal Smart Display 👋

Looking to build your own smart home display? You’re in the right place.

The **FastyBird Smart Panel** turns a simple screen — like a Raspberry Pi with a touchscreen — into a powerful, customizable dashboard for controlling and monitoring your smart home.

Whether you're a developer, hobbyist, or a curious tinkerer, this project gives you the tools to build a sleek interface without relying on closed ecosystems or cloud-based systems. It’s open, flexible, and fully under your control.
