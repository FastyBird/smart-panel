# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Got questions? Here are answers to some of the most common issues and scenarios new users encounter when setting up or
using the Smart Panel.

---

## I can’t connect to `smart-panel.local`

- Make sure your Raspberry Pi is **powered on** and **connected to the same network** as your computer.
- Try connecting using the Pi’s IP address instead.
- Some networks or routers don’t support `.local` domains. In that case:
	- Check your router’s connected device list for the IP.
	- On Windows/macOS, install [Bonjour](https://support.apple.com/kb/dl999?locale=en_US) if not already installed.

## What’s the default SSH username and password?

- **Username**: `pi`
- **Password**: `raspberry`

If you changed it during flashing (e.g., using Raspberry Pi Imager), use your custom credentials.

## The display app doesn’t start after boot

- Make sure the panel service is installed and enabled (see the Installation section).
- Confirm the display and touch panel wiring is correct.
- To check if the display app is running, use:

```bash copy
sudo systemctl status smart-panel-display
```

- To view logs for debugging:

```bash copy
sudo journalctl -u smart-panel-display -b
```

<Callout type="info">
	The display app is powered by `flutter-pi` and runs as a system service named `smart-panel-display`. It should start
	automatically on boot if installed correctly.
</Callout>

## Why can’t I see any devices in the Admin app?

- Devices must be added manually via the Admin app or automatically synced by a plugin (e.g., Home Assistant).
- Not all plugins support device auto-discovery — check the plugin’s documentation.

## How do I reset or reconfigure my Smart Panel?

- SSH into your Raspberry Pi.
- All runtime data is stored in:

```bash copy
/opt/smart-panel/var
```

This includes:

- `data/config.yaml` – Your panel configuration
- `db/database.sqlite` – The main system database

To fully reset your panel:

1. Stop the services:

```bash copy
sudo systemctl stop smart-panel-backend
sudo systemctl stop smart-panel-admin
sudo systemctl stop smart-panel-display
```

2. Delete the config and database files:

```bash copy
sudo rm /opt/smart-panel/var/data/config.yaml
sudo rm /opt/smart-panel/var/db/database.sqlite
```

3. Restart the services and the onboarding will start fresh:

```bash copy
sudo systemctl start smart-panel-backend
sudo systemctl start smart-panel-admin
sudo systemctl start smart-panel-display
```

## Can I use the panel without the touchscreen?

Yes — the panel can run without a touchscreen, and you can still manage everything using the Admin UI, which is fully
web-based and accessible from any browser.

<Callout type="info">
	However, the panel is designed to be **interactive**. Without a touchscreen, you’ll be limited to **a single static page**
	without user interaction.
</Callout>

In the future, support for **physical buttons**, **dials**, and **other** input methods is planned to enhance usability
even on non-touch displays.
