# Preparation

Letâ€™s get your **Raspberry Pi** up and running with the operating system and the Smart Panel software. This part will
walk you through flashing the SD card and doing the first boot.

The easiest and most reliable way is to use the **Raspberry Pi Imager**.

## Recommended: Using Raspberry Pi Imager

<Steps>
	### Download Raspberry Pi Imager

	You can get the Raspberry Pi Imager from the official site:

	[https://www.raspberrypi.com/software](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software)

	It's available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

	### Insert the SD Card

	Insert a microSD card (at least 8GB recommended) into your computerâ€™s card reader.

	### Choose Operating System

	In Raspberry Pi Imager:

	1. Click Choose OS
	2. Select Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit) (This is a lightweight, headless version perfect for embedded panels)

	</p>

	### Configure Advanced Options

	Click the **Next** and then **Edit settings**.

	Set the following:

	On the **General** tab:

	- Set username and password (e.g. pi / raspberry)
	- Configure Wi-Fi (SSID, password, country)
	- Set hostname (e.g. smart-panel.local)

	On the **Services** tab:

	- Enable SSH

	<p align="center">
		<img src="/images/imager-settings.png" alt="Raspberry Pi Imager settings" />
	</p>

	<Callout>
		These options are saved per session. You can optionally make them default for future flashes.
	</Callout>

	When finished, click **Yes** to apply the settings.

	</p>

	### Flash the OS

	Click **Yes** to begin flashing the image. This may take a few minutes.

	</p>

	Once done, remove the SD card safely and insert it into your Raspberry Pi.
</Steps>

## Advanced: Using Balena Etcher

If you're a more advanced user or prefer full control, you can flash the image manually using [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.io/)

<Steps>
	### Download the OS

	We recommend using [Raspberry Pi OS Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/), since itâ€™s
	lightweight and ideal for embedded use.

	### Flash the SD Card

	1. Insert the microSD card into your computer.
	2. Use Etcher to write the OS image.
	3. Once flashing is done, donâ€™t remove the card just yet!

	### Enable Wi-Fi

	Create a file named `wpa_supplicant.conf` with your Wi-Fi credentials:

	```conf
	country=CZ
	ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
	update_config=1

	network={
		ssid="YourSSID"
		psk="YourPassword"
	}
	```

	### Enable SSH

	Create an **empty file** called `ssh` (with no extension) to enable SSH.

	### Finalize

	Save both files in the boot partition before inserting the SD card into your Pi.
</Steps>

## First Boot

1. Insert the microSD into the Pi.
2. Power it on.
3. Wait a minute or two for the initial setup.

**You can connect to your Pi via SSH using:**

```bash
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
```

<Callout type="info">
	Default password: **raspberry**
</Callout>

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Once the Pi is online and accessible, youâ€™re ready to install the Smart Panel backend and panel app.
