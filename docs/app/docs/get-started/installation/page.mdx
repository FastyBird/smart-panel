# Installation

Now that your Raspberry Pi is set up, itâ€™s time to install the software that powers your Smart Panel: the backend and the panel UI.

---

<Steps>
	## Connect to your Pi via SSH

	If youâ€™re setting up your Smart Panel without a monitor and keyboard, the easiest way to access your Raspberry Pi is
	over the network using SSH.

	You can do this from another computer on the same network:

	```bash copy
	ssh pi@smart-panel.local
	```

	<Callout>
		Default password: **raspberry**
	</Callout>

	<Callout type="info">
		This works because you set the hostname as **smart-panel** during the OS flashing step. If you used a different hostname,
		replace it accordingly (e.g. `pi@your-name.local`).
	</Callout>

	<Callout type="info">
		If `.local` domains don't work on your system (e.g. Windows without Bonjour), you can find the IP address of your Pi
		from your routerâ€™s interface and connect like this:
	</Callout>

	```bash copy
	ssh pi@192.168.x.x
	```

	<Callout>
		If youâ€™re using a monitor and keyboard directly connected to the Pi, you can skip this step and run all commands in
		the terminal.
	</Callout>

	## Update Your System

	Before installing the Smart Panel, itâ€™s a good idea to make sure your Raspberry Pi is up to date:

	```bash copy
	sudo apt update & sudo apt upgrade -y
	```

	<Callout type="info">
		This updates all system packages to their latest versions, which helps ensure compatibility and security.
	</Callout>

	## Install Git

	Git is a version control tool used to download and manage the Smart Panelâ€™s source code. Weâ€™ll use it to clone the
	project repository from GitHub.

	To install Git on your Raspberry Pi:

	```bash copy
	sudo apt install git -y
	```

	## Install Node.js

	Node.js powers the backend and admin interface. Use the official NodeSource setup script to install the latest **LTS** version of Node.js:

	```bash copy
	curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
	sudo apt install -y nodejs
	```

	<Callout type="info">
		This installs both node and npm.
	</Callout>

	## Install flutter-pi

	The Smart Panel UI is written in Flutter and runs on your Raspberry Pi using [flutter-pi](https://github.com/ardera/flutter-pi),
	a lightweight runtime that doesnâ€™t require **X11** or **Wayland**.

	### Install Required Dependencies

	```bash copy
	sudo apt install cmake libgl1-mesa-dev libgles2-mesa-dev libegl1-mesa-dev \
	libdrm-dev libgbm-dev ttf-mscorefonts-installer fontconfig libsystemd-dev \
	libinput-dev libudev-dev  libxkbcommon-dev -y
	```

	{<h4>Update the system fonts</h4>}

	```bash copy
	sudo fc-cache
	```

	### Build and Install flutter-pi

	First, create a directory where flutter-pi will live and make sure your user owns it:

	```bash copy
	sudo mkdir /opt/flutter-pi
	sudo chown -R ${USER}: /opt/flutter-pi
	```

	Now clone the flutter-pi repository:

	```bash copy
	git clone https://github.com/ardera/flutter-pi.git /opt/flutter-pi
	```

	Install build dependencies and compile flutter-pi (run as user pi):

	```bash copy
	cd /opt/flutter-pi
	mkdir build && cd build
	cmake ..
	make -j`nproc`
	sudo make install
	```

	Give the **pi** permission to use 3D acceleration:

	<Callout type="warning">
		Potential security hazard. If you don't want to do this, launch Smart Panel UI using sudo instead.
	</Callout>

	```bash copy
	sudo usermod -a -G render pi
	```

	<Callout type="info">
		Once installed, youâ€™ll be able to run the Smart Panel UI directly from the console using the *flutter-pi* command.
	</Callout>

	### Enable KMS/DRM

	To ensure proper display rendering, your Raspberry Pi must use the KMS (Kernel Mode Setting) graphics driver. This is
	required for flutter-pi to access the display via DRM.

	Open the boot config file:

	```bash copy
	sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
	```

	Look for this line and make sure it is **enabled** (not commented out):

	```bash copy
	dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d
	```

	<Callout type="info">
		If itâ€™s not present, add it at the bottom of the file.
	</Callout>

	Reboot to apply changes:

	```bash copy
	sudo reboot
	```

	<Callout type="info">
		If you previously had `dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d` (the fake KMS driver), it should be **removed or commented out**.
	</Callout>

	## Install InfluxDB

	The Smart Panel backend uses **InfluxDB** to store time-series data like temperature, humidity, or power usage.

	To install InfluxDB v1.8:

	```bash copy
	wget -qO- https://repos.influxdata.com/influxdata-archive_compat.key | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/influxdata.asc
	```

	```bash copy
	echo "deb https://repos.influxdata.com/debian bookworm stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/influxdata.list
	```

	```bash copy
	sudo apt install influxdb=1.8.10-1 -y
	```

	Then enable and start the service:

	```bash copy
	sudo systemctl enable influxdb
	```

	```bash copy
	sudo systemctl start influxdb
	```

	To verify that InfluxDB is running:

	```bash copy
	influxd version
	```

	You should see:

	```bash
	InfluxDB v1.8.10 (git: ...)
	```

	<Callout type="warning">
		Make sure you're using InfluxDB **v1.8**. Installing **InfluxDB 2.x** will not work.
	</Callout>

	## Install the Smart Panel Application

	To get the full Smart Panel softwareâ€”including the backend, admin UI, and the display appâ€”youâ€™ll need to download and
	unpack the latest release.

	Create the target directory and give your user ownership:

	```bash copy
	sudo mkdir -p /opt/smart-panel
	sudo chown -R ${USER}:${USER} /opt/smart-panel
	```

	Create the storage directory and give your user ownership:

	```bash copy
	sudo mkdir -p /var/smart-panel
	sudo chown -R ${USER}:${USER} /var/smart-panel
	```

	Move into the project directory:

	```bash copy
	cd /opt/smart-panel
	```

	Download and Unpack the Latest Release:

	```bash copy
	wget https://github.com/FastyBird/smart-panel/releases/latest/download/smart-panel.tar.gz
	tar -xzf smart-panel.tar.gz -C .
	rm smart-panel.tar.gz
	```

	<Callout type="info">
		This archive contains everything you need: backend, admin UI, and the prebuilt display app.
	</Callout>

	Run the database migrations to initialize the database:

	```bash copy
	npm run migration:run
	```

	<Callout type="success">
		This creates all required tables in the application database so your Smart Panel can start working right away.
	</Callout>

	## Run Backend, Admin & Display as Services

	Youâ€™ll want your Smart Panel to automatically launch on boot. Hereâ€™s how to set up systemd services for both backend and display:

	### Backend & Admin Service

	Create a service file:

	```bash copy
	sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/smart-panel-backend.service
	```

	Paste this:

	```bash copy
	[Unit]
	Description=Smart Panel Backend & Admin Service
	After=network.target

	[Service]
	User=pi
	WorkingDirectory=/opt/smart-panel
	ExecStart=npm start
	Restart=always
	Environment=NODE_ENV=production

	[Install]
	WantedBy=multi-user.target
	```

	Enable and start the service:

	```bash copy
	sudo systemctl enable smart-panel-backend
	sudo systemctl start smart-panel-backend
	```

	<Callout type="info">
		The **Admin Interface** is already bundled and served through the backend â€” you donâ€™t need to run it separately.
	</Callout>

	### Display Service

	Create the display service file:

	```bash copy
	sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/smart-panel-display.service
	```

	Paste this:

	```bash copy
	[Unit]
	Description=Smart Panel Display App
	After=network.target
	Requires=smart-panel-backend.service

	[Service]
	User=pi
	WorkingDirectory=/opt/smart-panel/display
	ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/flutter-pi --release .
	Restart=always

	[Install]
	WantedBy=multi-user.target
	```

	<Callout type="default">
		Want to rotate the display? Add the `-p` (physical rotation) flag to the `ExecStart` line. For example:

		```bash copy
		ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/flutter-pi -p 270 --release .
		```

		Valid rotation values: `0`, `90`, `180`, `270`
	</Callout>

	Enable and start the service:

	```bash copy
	sudo systemctl enable smart-panel-display
	sudo systemctl start smart-panel-display
	```

	---

	Now, all three apps â€” **backend**, **admin**, and **display** â€” will automatically launch on boot and restart if they crash.
</Steps>
