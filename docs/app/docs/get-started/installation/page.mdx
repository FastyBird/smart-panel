# Installation

Now that your Raspberry Pi is set up, itâ€™s time to install the software that powers your Smart Panel: the backend and the panel UI.

---

<Steps>
	## Connect to your Pi via SSH

	If youâ€™re setting up your Smart Panel without a monitor and keyboard, the easiest way to access your Raspberry Pi is
	over the network using SSH.

	You can do this from another computer on the same network:

	```bash copy
	ssh pi@smart-panel.local
	```

	<Callout>
		Default password: **raspberry**
	</Callout>

	<Callout type="info">
		This works because you set the hostname as **smart-panel** during the OS flashing step. If you used a different hostname,
		replace it accordingly (e.g. `pi@your-name.local`).
	</Callout>

	<Callout type="info">
		If `.local` domains don't work on your system (e.g. Windows without Bonjour), you can find the IP address of your Pi
		from your routerâ€™s interface and connect like this:
	</Callout>

	```bash copy
	ssh pi@192.168.x.x
	```

	<Callout>
		If youâ€™re using a monitor and keyboard directly connected to the Pi, you can skip this step and run all commands in
		the terminal.
	</Callout>

	## Install Git

	Git is a version control tool used to download and manage the Smart Panelâ€™s source code. Weâ€™ll use it to clone the
	project repository from GitHub.

	To install Git on your Raspberry Pi:

	```bash copy
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install git -y
	```

	## Install Node.js & pnpm

	Node.js powers the backend and admin interface. [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) is a fast, disk-efficient package manager used to install dependencies.

	### Install Node.js

	Use the official NodeSource setup script to install the latest **LTS** version of Node.js:

	```bash copy
	curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
	sudo apt install -y nodejs
	```

	<Callout type="info">
		This installs both node and npm.
	</Callout>

	### Install pnpm

	After Node.js is installed, you can install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) globally:

	```bash copy
	npm install -g pnpm
	```

	<Callout type="info">
		Why [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)? Itâ€™s faster and uses less disk space than npm or yarn.
	</Callout>

	## Install flutter-pi

	The Smart Panel UI is written in Flutter and runs on your Raspberry Pi using [flutter-pi](https://github.com/ardera/flutter-pi),
	a lightweight runtime that doesnâ€™t require **X11** or **Wayland**.

	{<h3>Install Required Dependencies</h3>}

	```bash copy
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install -y cmake pkg-config libglvnd-dev libdrm-dev libgbm-dev \
	libinput-dev libudev-dev libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-dev clang ninja-build
	```

	{<h3>Build and Install flutter-pi</h3>}

	First, create a directory where flutter-pi will live and make sure your user owns it:

	```bash copy
	sudo mkdir /opt/flutter-pi
	sudo chown -R ${USER}: /opt/flutter-pi
	```

	Now clone the flutter-pi repository:

	```bash copy
	git clone https://github.com/ardera/flutter-pi.git /opt/flutter-pi
	```

	Install build dependencies and compile flutter-pi (run as user pi):

	```bash copy
	cd /opt/flutter-pi
	cmake -Bbuild -GNinja
	ninja -C build
	sudo ninja -C build install
	```

	<Callout type="info">
		Once installed, youâ€™ll be able to run the Smart Panel UI directly from the console using the *flutter-pi* command.
	</Callout>

	## Enable KMS/DRM

	To ensure proper display rendering, your Raspberry Pi must use the KMS (Kernel Mode Setting) graphics driver. This is
	required for flutter-pi to access the display via DRM.

	Open the boot config file:

	```bash copy
	sudo nano /boot/config.txt
	```

	Look for this line and make sure it is **enabled** (not commented out):

	```bash copy
	dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d
	```

	<Callout type="info">
		If itâ€™s not present, add it at the bottom of the file.
	</Callout>

	Reboot to apply changes:

	```bash copy
	sudo reboot
	```

	<Callout type="info">
		If you previously had `dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d` (the fake KMS driver), it should be **removed or commented out**.
	</Callout>

	## Install InfluxDB

	The Smart Panel backend uses **InfluxDB** to store time-series data like temperature, humidity, or power usage.

	To install InfluxDB v1.8:

	```bash copy
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install influxdb
	```

	Then enable and start the service:

	```bash copy
	sudo systemctl enable influxdb
	sudo systemctl start influxdb
	```

	To verify that InfluxDB is running:

	```bash copy
	influx
	```

	This will launch the InfluxDB shell (> prompt). To exit:

	```bash copy
	exit
	```

	<Callout type="warning">
		Make sure you're using InfluxDB **v1.8**. Installing **InfluxDB 2.x** will not work.
	</Callout>

	## Clone the Repository

	To get the full source code and tools for the Smart Panel, youâ€™ll need to clone the GitHub repository.

	Create the directory and set ownership so your user can write to it:

	```bash copy
	sudo mkdir -p /opt/smart-panel
	sudo chown -R ${USER}:${USER} /opt/smart-panel
	```

	Clone the GitHub repository into the folder:

	```bash copy
	git clone https://github.com/FastyBird/smart-panel.git /opt/smart-panel
	```

	Move into the cloned project directory:

	```bash copy
	cd /opt/smart-panel
	```

	## Install the Display application

	The Smart Panel display is a pre-built Flutter app that you can easily download and run on your device.

	Create the directory and set ownership so your user can write to it:

	```bash copy
	sudo mkdir -p /opt/smart-panel/display
	sudo chown -R ${USER}: /opt/smart-panel/display
	```

	Download and unpack the latest release:

	```bash copy
	cd /opt/smart-panel/display
	wget https://github.com/FastyBird/smart-panel/releases/latest/download/display.tar.gz
	tar -xzf display.tar.gz -C .
	rm display.tar.gz
	```

	## Bootstrap the Project

	This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to manage the monorepo.

	Run the bootstrap command to install packages, generate types, run database migrations, and build the admin UI:

	```bash
	cd /opt/smart-panel
	pnpm run bootstrap
	```

	<Callout type="info">
		This command prepares the backend and admin UI for use. The display app was installed separately in an earlier step.
	</Callout>

	## Run Backend, Admin & Display as Services

	Youâ€™ll want your Smart Panel to boot up and run the backend and display automatically. Letâ€™s set them up using systemd services.

	### Backend Service

	Create a service file:

	```bash copy
	sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/smart-panel-backend.service
	```

	Paste this:

	```bash copy
	[Unit]
	Description=Smart Panel Backend Service
	After=network.target

	[Service]
	User=pi
	WorkingDirectory=/opt/smart-panel
	ExecStart=/home/pi/.local/share/pnpm/pnpm exec pnpm --filter @fastybird/smart-panel-backend start:prod
	Restart=always
	Environment=NODE_ENV=production
	Environment=FB_DB_SYNC=true

	[Install]
	WantedBy=multi-user.target
	```

	Enable and start the service:

	```bash copy
	sudo systemctl enable smart-panel-backend
	sudo systemctl start smart-panel-backend
	```

	### Admin Service

	Create a service file:

	```bash copy
	sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/smart-panel-admin.service
	```

	Paste this:

	```bash copy
	[Unit]
	Description=Smart Panel Admin UI
	After=network.target

	[Service]
	User=pi
	WorkingDirectory=/opt/smart-panel
	ExecStart=/home/pi/.local/share/pnpm/pnpm exec pnpm --filter @fastybird/smart-panel-admin start:prod
	Restart=always
	Environment=NODE_ENV=production

	[Install]
	WantedBy=multi-user.target
	```

	Enable and start the service:

	```bash copy
	sudo systemctl enable smart-panel-admin
	sudo systemctl start smart-panel-admin
	```

	### Display Service

	Create the display service file:

	```bash copy
	sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/smart-panel-display.service
	```

	Paste this:

	```bash copy
	[Unit]
	Description=Smart Panel Display App
	After=network.target

	[Service]
	User=pi
	WorkingDirectory=/opt/smart-panel/display
	ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/flutter-pi .
	Restart=always

	[Install]
	WantedBy=multi-user.target
	```

	Enable and start the service:

	```bash copy
	sudo systemctl enable smart-panel-display
	sudo systemctl start smart-panel-display
	```

	---

	Now, all three apps â€” **backend**, **admin**, and **display** â€” will automatically launch on boot and restart if they crash.
</Steps>
