# Onboarding

Before you can start managing devices or customizing your dashboard, your Smart Panel needs to be **linked to a user account**.
This process ensures secure access and allows your panel to communicate with backend services.

Currently, onboarding is available **only via the command line**. In a future update, a web-based onboarding interface
will make this even easier — stay tuned!

## Registering the Owner

Run this command to register the owner of this Smart Panel:

```bash copy
pnpm onboard
```

<Callout type="info">
	This is a shortcut for:
	`pnpm --filter @fastybird/smart-panel-backend run cli users:register-owner`
	to simplify the process.
</Callout>

You'll be guided through an interactive prompt:

```bash
> Registering Smart Panel Owner
────────────────────────────────────────

? Owner username … johndoe
? Owner password … ************
```

<Callout type="info">
	Use a secure username and password combination — these will be used to log in to the admin interface.
</Callout>

If everything goes well, you'll see:

```bash
✔ Owner account successfully registered
```

## Display Onboarding

Once the display service is started (as shown in the previous [installation](/docs/get-started/installation) step), the **Display UI**
will automatically boot into its default onboarding state.

There is **no manual onboarding required** for the display at this stage. It will:

- Connect to the backend
- Fetch configuration
- Show a default splash screen or pairing status

<Callout type="info">
	Future versions will include a guided UI onboarding wizard.
</Callout>
