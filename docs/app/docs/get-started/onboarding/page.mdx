# Onboarding

Before you can start managing devices or customizing your dashboard, your Smart Panel needs to be **linked to a user account**.
This process ensures secure access and allows your panel to communicate with backend services.

Currently, onboarding is available **only via the command line**. In a future update, a web-based onboarding interface
will make this even easier — stay tuned!

## Registering the Owner

Run this command to register the owner of this Smart Panel:

```bash copy
npm run onboard yourusername secretpassword
```

<Callout type="info">
	Use a secure username and password combination — these will be used to log in to the admin interface.
</Callout>

If everything goes well, you'll see:

```bash
✔ Owner account successfully registered
```

## Optional: Seed with Demo Data

To try out the Smart Panel without having to manually create devices or dashboard pages, you can **seed the system with demo data**:

```bash copy
npm run seed
```

This will:
- Add a few pre-configured demo devices
- Set up a sample dashboard layout with pages and tiles

<Callout>
	This is ideal for first-time users or contributors evaluating the system.
</Callout>

You can still remove or override this data later using the admin interface.

## Display Onboarding

Once the display service is started (as shown in the previous [installation](/docs/get-started/installation) step), the **Display UI**
will automatically boot into its default onboarding state.

There is **no manual onboarding required** for the display at this stage. It will:

- Connect to the backend
- Fetch configuration
- Show a default splash screen or pairing status

<Callout type="info">
	Future versions will include a guided UI onboarding wizard.
</Callout>
