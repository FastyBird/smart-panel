# Tiles Page Plugin

The Tiles Page Plugin defines the most common page type used in the Smart Panel dashboard — a grid of tiles that display device states, weather, time, and more.

## What It Does

This plugin powers the **Tiles Page** layout, allowing you to:

- Organize dashboard content into a structured grid
- Place multiple tiles like device states, weather, and time in one view
- Customize page structure visually through the Admin App

The layout is flexible and ideal for everyday use on a wall-mounted smart panel.
