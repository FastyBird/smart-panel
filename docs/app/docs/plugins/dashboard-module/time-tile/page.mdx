# Time Tile Plugin

The Time Tile Plugin is a simple yet essential plugin that allows the Smart Panel dashboard to display the current time
on your wall-mounted interface.

## What It Does

This plugin adds a time tile to the Dashboard module. It provides a clear, always-up-to-date display of the current time
and date, making it ideal for the top of a screen or part of a broader status overview.

Once added, the time tile:

- Automatically syncs with the configured timezone
- Supports both 12-hour and 24-hour time formats
- Displays time and optionally the date in a minimal, clean layout

---

## Configuration

No plugin configuration is required in the `config.yaml` file. However, the time display depends on proper panel localization settings.

<Callout type="info">
		The time tile uses values provided by the panel's language settings, which must be set in your `config.yaml` file:

	```yaml
		language:
			timezone: Europe/Prague
			time_format: 24h
	```
</Callout>
