# Dashboard Plugins

The **Dashboard module** defines how information and controls are presented on the Smart Panel display. It provides a flexible
layout system with support for **pages**, **tiles**, and **data sources** — all of which can be extended and customized through plugins.

## What Dashboard Plugins Do

Plugins in the Dashboard module allow developers to introduce new visual and interactive components to the panel UI. These plugins can:

- Add new **page types** (e.g., fullscreen graphs, multi-column layouts)
- Provide **tile types** for displaying devices, sensors, charts, or actions
- Register custom **data sources** that pull or compute values from devices or external systems

## Extending the Display with Plugins

The modular nature of the dashboard allows for highly personalized UI configurations. For example:

- A tile plugin might display a **thermostat control**, **light dimmer**, or **weather forecast**
- A card plugin might show a **group of sensors** in a compact layout
- A page plugin might render a **dedicated climate page** or a **media control interface**

Each plugin integrates deeply with the backend to ensure values are synchronized and actions are propagated in real-time.

## Plugin Capabilities

Dashboard plugins typically implement:

- A backend definition (metadata, config structure)
- A frontend representation (Vue or Flutter component)
- Support for layout, theming, and responsiveness
- Data binding to real device properties or derived sources

	The goal is to provide a seamless and extensible user experience, where panels can be tailored to any room, purpose, or user preference.

## Future Opportunities

As the ecosystem grows, plugins can enable advanced dashboard features such as:

- Real-time charts or historical data visualization
- Voice control overlays
- Specialized layouts for different screen sizes
- Touch gestures or accessibility-enhanced components

Plugins under the Dashboard module are key to making the Smart Panel both powerful and beautiful — designed to fit the specific needs of each smart home.
