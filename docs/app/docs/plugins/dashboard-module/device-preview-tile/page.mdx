# Device Tile Plugin

The Device Tile Plugin allows you to display the current state of a selected device and interact with it directly from
the Smart Panel dashboard.

## What It Does

This plugin enables dashboard tiles to show:

- The **primary state** of a selected device (e.g., On/Off, Temperature, Brightness)
- Additional **data sources** (e.g., sensor values) related to the device
- **Interactive controls** to toggle or adjust devices directly from the panel
- **Quick access to device details** — tapping the tile opens a full detail view of the selected device

It’s a powerful way to visualize and control smart home devices at a glance.

## Configuration

No plugin-specific configuration is required in the `config.yaml` file. All setup is done within the Admin App.

## Integration Steps

<Steps>
	### Open the Admin App

	Navigate to the Admin App via your browser and ensure your devices are already integrated.

	### Edit or Create a Page

	Go to your desired dashboard page or create a new one for your layout.

	### Add a Device Tile

	Insert a new tile and choose **Device Tile** as the tile type from the options.

	### Select a Device

	Choose the device you want to display on the tile. You’ll be able to select its primary state (like power status or temperature).

	### Attach Data Sources (Optional)

	You can enhance the tile by adding one or more data sources from the same device (like humidity or battery level).

	### Save and Sync

	Once saved, your configuration is instantly applied. The Smart Panel display updates in real time without requiring any manual sync.
