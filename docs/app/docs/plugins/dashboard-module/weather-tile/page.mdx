# Weather Tile Plugin

The Weather Tile Plugin integrates weather information into your Smart Panel dashboard using data provided by the Weather
module. It offers two types of tiles: Current Weather and Weekly Forecast.

## What It Does

This plugin connects to the Weather module, which pulls data from OpenWeather, and displays it on your panel through two
distinct tile options:

- **Current Weather Tile** — shows temperature, weather condition, and location
- **Forecast Tile** — displays a 7-day forecast including temperature trends and conditions

Both tile types:

- Sync automatically with the configured weather provider (currently OpenWeather)
- Support location-based weather updates
- Display in a clean, visual format with icons and text

## Configuration

No plugin configuration is required in the `config.yaml` file. However, the Weather module must be configured to enable
weather data fetching.
