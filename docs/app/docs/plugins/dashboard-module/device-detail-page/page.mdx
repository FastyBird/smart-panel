# Device Detail Page Plugin

The Device Detail Page Plugin enables full-screen, focused views of specific devices directly within the dashboard
layout — ideal for use cases like thermostats, sensors, or multi-functional devices.

## What It Does

This plugin adds a **Device Detail Page** to the dashboard module. Unlike device tiles, which show only basic status,
the detail page offers:

- A dedicated screen for a single device
- Display of the main state and all data sources
- Direct controls for available actions
- A richer and more interactive user interface

These pages can be added manually and don't require the user to tap on a device tile — making them perfect for always-visible critical devices.

## Configuration

No configuration is required in the `config.yaml` file. The plugin is enabled by default.
