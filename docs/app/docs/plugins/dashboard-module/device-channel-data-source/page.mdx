# Device Channel Data Source Plugin

The Device Channel Data Source Plugin allows you to display the state of a specific property from any connected device channel — such as temperature, brightness, power status, and more.

## What It Does

This plugin adds a data source to the dashboard module that reads from a selected **device channel property**. It can be used by:

- Tiles (e.g., status tiles, graphs, indicators)
- Pages (e.g., headers or device views)
- Any visual component that supports external data sources

Once configured, it continuously reflects the live value of the chosen property — ideal for displaying real-time device feedback.

## Configuration

No configuration is required in the `config.yaml` file. The plugin is available by default.
