# Plugins Overview

FastyBird Smart Panel is built on a modular, plugin-based architecture that makes it easy to extend the platform's functionality
without modifying its core. Plugins allow the system to adapt to different environments, protocols, devices, and user needs
— all while maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase.

Whether you're working with the **Devices**, **Dashboard**, or any other module, each part of the system supports
dynamic plugin registration. This gives developers the freedom to integrate new features, support additional platforms,
or introduce custom behaviors in a consistent and reusable way.

Plugins can provide:

- **Device integrations** for external systems like Home Assistant or custom APIs
- **Dashboard extensions** with new tile types, layout logic, or visual components

By design, plugins are self-contained and declarative. This ensures that contributors and integrators can extend the platform without introducing tight coupling or complexity.

	FastyBird’s plugin system is what makes the Smart Panel ecosystem truly extensible — whether you're building for your
	home or creating reusable modules for others.
