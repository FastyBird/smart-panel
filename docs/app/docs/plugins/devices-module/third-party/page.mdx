# Third-Party Plugin

The **Third-Party plugin** allows you to connect your own smart devices and services to the Smart Panel backend through
simple API endpoints. It‚Äôs the most flexible integration method, ideal for custom hardware or external systems not yet
natively supported.

## What It Does

This plugin enables Smart Panel to communicate with arbitrary third-party devices:

- Send device commands to external services via HTTP
- Accept incoming state updates from external systems
- Maintain real-time device state within the Smart Panel ecosystem

No advanced configuration is required in the panel. Instead, all logic lives in the endpoint integration of the third-party system.

---

## Configuration

No plugin configuration is required in the `config.yaml` file. All setup is done per device using the Admin App or API.

Each third-party device must define its:

- **Command Endpoint** ‚Äî where the Smart Panel should send commands when the user interacts with the panel
- **State Update Endpoint** ‚Äî used by third-party systems to notify Smart Panel when device state changes

For the full data structure and API expectations, see the third-party device specification below:

<Cards.Card
	icon={
		<Icon
			path={mdiApi}
			size={2}
		/>
	}
	title="Third-party Device Schema"
	href="https://fastybird.stoplight.io/docs/smart-panel/branches/main/e5c0bd8159c9f-third-party-device"
	arrow
	className={"mt-8"}
/>

---

## How It Works

### Sending Commands

When a user interacts with a device (e.g. turns on a switch), the backend calls the configured **command endpoint** for the given device. This request follows this API definition:

<Cards.Card
	icon={
		<Icon
			path={mdiApi}
			size={2}
		/>
	}
	title="Send command to third-party device"
	href="https://fastybird.stoplight.io/docs/smart-panel/branches/main/69d59e31c8650-send-command-to-third-party-device"
	arrow
	className={"mt-8"}
/>

### Receiving State Updates

When a third-party device changes its state, it must call the Smart Panel API to update the appropriate property:

<Cards.Card
	icon={
		<Icon
			path={mdiApi}
			size={2}
		/>
	}
	title="Update a device property"
	href="https://fastybird.stoplight.io/docs/smart-panel/branches/main/f093475494870-update-an-existing-property-for-a-channel"
	arrow
	className={"mt-8"}
/>

	In the future, this plugin will also support WebSocket-based communication using Socket.IO for more responsive and real-time integrations.

## Integration Steps

<Steps>
	#### Define Device in the Admin App

	Add your device via the Admin App. Choose the "Third-Party" device type and provide all required metadata.

	#### Set Command Endpoint

	In the device settings, specify the HTTP endpoint that will receive commands (e.g. toggles, state changes).

	#### Implement Command Listener

	Your backend should listen to incoming POST requests and execute the corresponding device action.

	#### Update Property States

	Whenever the device changes its state (e.g. temperature, switch status), send a POST request to Smart Panel to update the value.

	#### Test Communication

	Interact with the panel and verify that commands reach your service and state updates are reflected in the UI.
