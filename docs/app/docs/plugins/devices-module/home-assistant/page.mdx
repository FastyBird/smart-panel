# Home Assistant Plugin

The **Home Assistant plugin** bridges the Smart Panel with your Home Assistant instance, enabling the panel to display and control devices already integrated in your smart home setup.

## What It Does

This plugin allows you to connect the Devices module with your Home Assistant environment by manually mapping devices and entities. Once configured, you can:

- Read real-time device states
- Send control commands to Home Assistant
- Visualize sensor data, switch states, and more via the dashboard

## Current Limitations

<Callout type="warning">
	**Automatic mapping is not yet supported.**
	All Home Assistant devices and entities must currently be mapped manually in the Smart Panel Admin App.
</Callout>

These limitations are temporary. Future versions of the plugin will support automatic discovery and mapping via the WebSocket API and allow full setup via the Admin App UI.

## Configuration

To enable the plugin, you must manually define its settings inside your `config.yaml` file:

### Getting Your Home Assistant Access Token

To connect the Smart Panel with your Home Assistant instance, you’ll need to generate a **Long-Lived Access Token**. Follow the steps below:

<Steps>
	#### Open Home Assistant

	Log in to your Home Assistant instance through your browser. You’ll need to be logged in as the user who should own the access token.

	#### Go to Your Profile

	Click on your user name or avatar at the bottom of the sidebar to open your user profile page. This is where all your personal settings and security tools live.

	#### Find the Access Token Section

	On the **Security** tab scroll to the section called **"Long-Lived Access Tokens"** — this is where you can manage tokens.

	#### Create a New Token

	Click on **"Create Token”**, then give it a recognizable name like **Smart Panel Integration**. This helps identify it later if you need to revoke access.

	#### Copy and Store the Token

	The token will only be shown once. Copy it immediately and paste it into your configuration file under `/opt/smart-panel/var/data/config.yaml`. Treat it like a password.

	```yaml
	plugins:
		devices-home-assistant-plugin:
			api_key: generated-long-lived-access-token
			hostname: home-assistant.local:8123
	```

	| Key        | Description                                   |
	|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
	| `api_key`  | Your Home Assistant long-lived access token   |
	| `hostname` | Hostname or IP address of your Home Assistant |
</Steps>

<Callout  type={'info'}>
	You must restart the backend for configuration changes to take effect.
</Callout>

## How It Works

Once configured:

- The plugin connects to your Home Assistant instance using the provided WebSocket API
- Device and entity data must be manually linked to the Smart Panel’s internal model
- Each Home Assistant entity becomes a **channel** with one or more **properties**
- Property values are kept in sync with Home Assistant in real time
- User interactions on the panel (like toggling a light) are sent back to Home Assistant as commands

## Features

- ✅ Real-time updates via WebSocket
- ✅ Manual linking of Home Assistant entities to Smart Panel devices
- ✅ Bidirectional communication
- ✅ Support for common entity types

## Supported Entity Types

The plugin currently supports mapping of the following Home Assistant entity types:

- `light`
- `switch`
- `sensor`
- `climate`
- `binary_sensor`

Each supported entity type maps to corresponding Smart Panel properties (e.g., state, brightness, temperature).

The Home Assistant plugin brings the power of your existing automation setup into the Smart Panel ecosystem — and while manual setup is currently required, full automation is on the roadmap.
