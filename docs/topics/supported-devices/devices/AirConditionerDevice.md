### Use Case Scenarios {id="use-case-scenarios"}

1. **Cooling and Fan Control**:
    - Set a target temperature using the `cooler` and `temperature` channels.
    - Adjust fan speed and direction via the `fan` channel.

2. **Environmental Monitoring**:
    - Monitor room temperature (`temperature`) and humidity (`humidity`) for better climate control.
    - Detect leaks using the `leak` channel to ensure safety.

3. **Energy Management**:
    - Track power usage and energy consumption using the `electrical_power` and `electrical_energy` channels.
