## Required Channels {id="required-channels"}

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the fan:

| **Channel**          | **Description**                                                                | **Multiple** | **Details**                                |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `fan`                | Manages the fan's operation, including speed, direction, and activation.       | No           | [See details](FanChannel.md)               |
| `device_information` | Provides metadata about the device, such as manufacturer, model, and firmware. | No           | [See details](DeviceInformationChannel.md) |

## Developer Notes {id="developer-notes"}

1. **Channel Implementation**:
    - Implement all required channels for core fan functionality.
    - Add optional channels for energy monitoring if the fan supports these features.

2. **Integration**:
    - Map the `fan` channel to the fan's speed and direction control mechanisms.
    - Include the `device_information` channel for device identification.

3. **Energy Tracking**:
    - Use the `electrical_energy` and `electrical_power` channels to enhance energy efficiency features.

4. **Use Cases**:
    - Suitable for standalone fans, ceiling fans, or integrated HVAC systems.
    - Provides energy management capabilities when combined with optional channels.
