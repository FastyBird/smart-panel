### Use Case Scenarios {id="use-case-scenarios"}

1. **Heating and Temperature Control**:
    - Set a target temperature and activate heating through the `heater` and `temperature` channels.

2. **Environmental Monitoring**:
    - Monitor the room temperature using the `temperature` channel.
    - Use the `humidity` channel for enhanced climate control.

3. **Energy Management**:
    - Track power usage in real-time with the `electrical_power` channel.
    - Use the `electrical_energy` channel for long-term energy consumption insights.
