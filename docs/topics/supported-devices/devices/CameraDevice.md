### Use Case Scenarios {id="use-case-scenarios"}

1. **Surveillance and Monitoring**:
    - Stream video and capture images using the `camera` channel.
    - Detect motion through the `motion` channel for event-based recording.

2. **Audio Interaction**:
    - Enable two-way communication using the `microphone` and `speaker` channels.
    - Capture environmental audio for enhanced monitoring.

3. **Environmental Monitoring**:
    - Track temperature (`temperature`) and humidity (`humidity`) for situational awareness.
    - Monitor lighting conditions or control built-in lights via the `light` channel.

4. **Battery and Security Features**:
    - Monitor battery status using the `battery` channel for wireless cameras.
    - Use the `contact` channel to monitor associated doors or windows for security integration.
