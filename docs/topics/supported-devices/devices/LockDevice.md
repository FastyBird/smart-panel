### Use Case Scenarios {id="use-case-scenarios"}

1. **Access Control**:
    - Lock or unlock the device using the `lock` channel.
    - Monitor the current lock state through the same channel.

2. **Battery Monitoring**:
    - Keep track of the lock's battery status using the `battery` channel to avoid power-related issues.

3. **Security Monitoring**:
    - Detect door or access point status with the `contact` channel.
    - Use the `motion` channel for added security by monitoring nearby motion.

## Developer Notes {id="developer-notes"}

1. **Channel Implementation**:
    - Implement all required channels to ensure core locking functionality.
    - Add optional channels for advanced monitoring and security features.

2. **Integration**:
    - Ensure the `lock` channel is mapped to the physical or logical locking mechanism.
    - Include the `deviceInformation` channel for proper device identification.

3. **Power Management**:
    - Use the `battery` channel to provide feedback on power levels, particularly for battery-powered locks.

4. **Security Enhancements**:
    - Utilize the `contact` and `motion` channels to enhance the lock's utility in security applications.
