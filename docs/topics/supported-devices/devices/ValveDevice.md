## Required Channels {id="required-channels"}

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the valve device:

| **Channel**         | **Description**                                                                | **Multiple** | **Details**                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `valve`             | Controls the open/close state and operation of the valve.                      | No           | [See details](ValveChannel.md)             |
| `deviceInformation` | Provides metadata about the device, such as manufacturer, model, and firmware. | No           | [See details](DeviceInformationChannel.md) |

## Optional Channels {id="optional-channels"}

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel**        | **Description**                                                         | **Multiple** | **Details**                               |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `battery`          | Monitors the battery status, if the valve is battery-powered.           | No           | [See details](BatteryChannel.md)          |
| `electricalEnergy` | Tracks total energy consumption over time.                              | No           | [See details](ElectricalEnergyChannel.md) |
| `electricalPower`  | Provides real-time power usage information.                             | No           | [See details](ElectricalPowerChannel.md)  |
| `flow`             | Monitors the flow rate through the valve.                               | No           | [See details](FlowChannel.md)             |
| `leak`             | Detects leaks or other flow-related issues.                             | No           | [See details](LeakChannel.md)             |
| `pressure`         | Monitors the pressure level in the system where the valve is installed. | No           |  [See details](PressureChannel.md)        |

### Use Case Scenarios {id="use-case-scenarios"}

1. **Flow Control**:
    - Open or close the valve using the `valve` channel.
    - Monitor flow rate with the `flow` channel for precision control.

2. **Energy Monitoring**:
    - Track power usage and energy consumption using the `electricalPower` and `electricalEnergy` channels.

3. **System Safety**:
    - Use the `leak` channel to detect potential issues and ensure system integrity.
    - Monitor pressure levels through the `pressure` channel to prevent overloading.

4. **Battery Management**:
    - For battery-powered valves, monitor battery status using the `battery` channel.

## Developer Notes {id="developer-notes"}

1. **Channel Implementation**:
    - The `deviceInformation` and `valve` channels are mandatory for basic valve operation.
    - Implement optional channels to provide advanced features like flow rate monitoring or energy management.

2. **Integration**:
    - Ensure seamless operation with other system components using the `flow` and `pressure` channels.

3. **Extensibility**:
    - Add leak detection and energy tracking features using the `leak`, `electricalEnergy`, and `electricalPower` channels as needed.
