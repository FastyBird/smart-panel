## Required Channels {id="required-channels"}

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the lighting device:

| **Channel**         | **Description**                                                                       | **Multiple** | **Details**                                |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `light`             | Controls the lighting functionality, including power, brightness, and color settings. | Yes          | [See details](LightChannel.md)             |
| `deviceInformation` | Provides metadata about the device, such as manufacturer, model, and firmware.        | No           | [See details](DeviceInformationChannel.md) |

## Optional Channels {id="optional-channels"}

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel**        | **Description**                               | **Multiple** | **Details**                               |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `electricalEnergy` | Tracks total energy consumption over time.    | No           | [See details](ElectricalEnergyChannel.md) |
| `electricalPower`  | Provides real-time power usage information.   | No           | [See details](ElectricalPowerChannel.md)  |
| `illuminance`      | Measures the ambient light level in the room. | No           | [See details](IlluminanceChannel.md)      |

### Use Case Scenarios {id="use-case-scenarios"}

1. **Lighting Control**:
   - Turn the lights on or off and adjust brightness or color through the `light` channel.
   - Support multiple lighting zones or fixtures with independent controls.

2. **Environmental Monitoring**:
   - Measure ambient light levels using the `illuminance` channel for adaptive lighting.

3. **Energy Management**:
   - Track energy usage in real-time with the `electricalPower` channel.
   - Monitor long-term energy consumption with the `electricalEnergy` channel.

## Developer Notes {id="developer-notes"}

1. **Channel Implementation**:
   - Implement all required channels for basic lighting functionality.
   - Add optional channels for advanced features like energy tracking and light level monitoring.

2. **Integration**:
   - Map the `light` channel to the physical or logical controls for the lighting device.
   - Include the `deviceInformation` channel for proper device identification.

3. **Energy Tracking**:
   - Use `electricalEnergy` and `electricalPower` channels to offer energy usage insights.

4. **Extensibility**:
   - Add the `illuminance` channel for adaptive lighting based on room brightness.
   - Customize the `light` channel for advanced lighting effects or modes.
   - Support multiple `light` channels for complex lighting systems or multi-zone fixtures.
