## Required Channels {id="required-channels"}

These channels are mandatory for the functionality of the pump device:

| **Channel**         | **Description**                                                                | **Multiple** | **Details**                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `flow`              | Monitors the rate of fluid flow through the pump.                              | No           | [See details](FlowChannel.md)              |
| `switcher`          | Controls the on/off state of the pump.                                         | No           | [See details](SwitcherChannel.md)          |
| `deviceInformation` | Provides metadata about the device, such as manufacturer, model, and firmware. | No           | [See details](DeviceInformationChannel.md) |

## Optional Channels {id="optional-channels"}

These channels are optional and provide additional features:

| **Channel**        | **Description**                                  | **Multiple** | **Details**                               |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `electricalEnergy` | Tracks total energy consumption over time.       | No           | [See details](ElectricalEnergyChannel.md) |
| `electricalPower`  | Provides real-time power usage information.      | No           | [See details](ElectricalPowerChannel.md)  |
| `leak`             | Detects leaks in the pump or connected systems.  | No           | [See details](LeakChannel.md)             |
| `pressure`         | Monitors the pressure of the fluid being pumped. | No           | [See details](PressureChannel.md)         |

### Use Case Scenarios {id="use-case-scenarios"}

1. **Flow Control**:
    - Use the `switcher` channel to start or stop the pump.
    - Monitor the rate of fluid flow via the `flow` channel.

2. **Energy and Pressure Monitoring**:
    - Track real-time power usage and energy consumption with the `electricalPower` and `electricalEnergy` channels.
    - Ensure proper pump operation by monitoring the fluid pressure through the `pressure` channel.

3. **Safety and Leak Detection**:
    - Use the `leak` channel to detect potential leaks in the system and take corrective action.

4. **Device Metadata**:
    - Access pump-specific information such as manufacturer, model, and firmware through the `deviceInformation` channel.

## Developer Notes {id="developer-notes"}

1. **Channel Implementation**:
    - Implement all required channels for basic pump functionality.
    - Add optional channels for energy monitoring, safety, and operational enhancements if supported by the hardware.

2. **Integration**:
    - Ensure the `switcher` channel directly controls the pump's operation.
    - Include the `deviceInformation` channel for proper identification and metadata access.

3. **Extensibility**:
    - Optional channels like `leak`, `pressure`, `electricalEnergy`, and `electricalPower` can enhance the device's utility for monitoring and safety.
