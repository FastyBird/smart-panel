# Supported Devices and Channels

The **Supported Devices and Channels** section defines the virtual abstractions that enable the FastyBird Smart Panel
application to seamlessly interact with and manage a wide variety of systems. These abstractions are essential for providing
a unified, consistent interface to control and monitor physical hardware.

## Devices

Devices represent virtual models of physical hardware such as lights, thermostats, or cameras. Each device encapsulates
a unique set of functionalities tailored to its type. By adhering to the defined specifications, developers can ensure
smooth integration of these devices into the application ecosystem. This modular approach simplifies control and monitoring,
while also enabling future expansion to support additional device types.

## Channels

Channels are the building blocks of devices, representing specific functionalities or features. For example, a channel
might handle brightness control for a light or temperature monitoring for a thermostat. By organizing device capabilities
into discrete channels, the platform ensures flexibility and scalability while maintaining clarity in implementation.

## Purpose

This section serves as a comprehensive guide for developers and integrators to understand how devices and channels are
structured, enabling consistent development and integration. With this foundation, the FastyBird Smart Panel can adapt
to diverse use cases and evolving user needs.
