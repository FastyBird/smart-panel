# Junie Project Guidelines

This folder contains shared instructions for JetBrains Junie, which act as
AI-augmented development guidelines for the entire Smart Panel project.

All developers should follow these rules, and Junie will use them to generate
consistent code, tests, architecture, and multi-file changes.
